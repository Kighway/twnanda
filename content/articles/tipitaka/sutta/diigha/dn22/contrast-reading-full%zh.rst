       374. And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body?
       
       Here, monks, a monk who has gone to the wilderness, or has gone to the root of a tree, or has gone to an empty place, sits down. After folding his legs crosswise, setting his body straight,\ [AFn12]_ and establishing mindfulness at the front,\ [AFn13]_ being very mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.
       
       | While breathing in long, he knows “I am breathing in long”,
       | or, while breathing out long, he knows “I am breathing out long”;
       | or, while breathing in short, he knows “I am breathing in short”,
       | or, while breathing out short, he knows “I am breathing out short”.
       | 
       | Experiencing the whole body\ [AFn14]_ I will breathe in,\ [AFn15]_ like this he trains,
       | experiencing the whole body I will breathe out, like this he trains;
       | calming the bodily process I will breathe in, like this he trains,
       | calming the bodily process I will breathe out, like this he trains.

       Just as, monks, a clever turner or turner’s apprentice while making a long turn knows “I am making a long turn”, or, while making a short turn knows “I am making a short turn”,\ [AFn16]_

       | just so, monks, a monk while breathing in long, knows “I am breathing in long”,
       | or, while breathing out long, he knows “I am breathing out long”;
       | or, while breathing in short, he knows “I am breathing in short”,

       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to himself,\ [AFn17]_ or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to others,\ [AFn18]_ or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to himself and in regard to others,\ [AFn19]_ or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in the body, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in the body, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in the body, or else mindfulness that “there is a body” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness,\ [AFn20]_ and he dwells independent,\ [AFn21]_ and without being attached to anything in the world.\ [AFn22]_

       374. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the body?

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following the practice of my Teaching, having gone to the forest, or to the foot of a tree or to an empty, solitary place, sits down cross-legged, keeping his body erect, and sets up mindfulness, orienting it.\ [BpitFn016]_

       Then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out.

       Breathing in a long inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation.

       Breathing in a short inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation.

       He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. [By being fully conscious of the inhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. [By being fully conscious of the exhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out.\ [BpitFn017]_

       Just as, bhikkhus, a skilful turner or a turner's apprentice knows a long pull\ [BpitFn018]_ when a long pull is made, or knows a short pull when a short pull is made, even so, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu breathing in a long inhalation is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation, or breathing in a short inhalation is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. He trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his.\ [BpitFn019]_

       Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena\ [BpitFn020]_ of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his\ [BpitFn021]_ or which is that of others.

       When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes.\ [BpitFn022]_

       And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.\ [BpitFn023]_ That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights\ [BpitFn024]_ progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.

Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns, 'I am making a long turn,' or when making a short turn discerns, 'I am making a short turn'; in the same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long' ... He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'

       "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or externally on the body in & of itself, or both internally & externally on the body in & of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world.

       Just as if, bhikkhus, a skilful butcher or a butcher's apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and cut it up into portions should be sitting at the junction of four main roads,\ [BpitFn033]_ even so the bhikkhu examines and reflects on this very body in whatever position it remains or is placed, as composed of the primary elements:

       “In this way, in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body internally… externally…both internally and externally. He abides contemplating the nature of arising … of passing away … of both arising and passing away in the body. Mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body.

And again, bhikkhus, as if the bhikkhu is seeing a body, one day dead, or two days dead, or three days dead, swollen, turning black and blue, and festering, abandoned in the charnel-ground, he applies this perception to his own body thus: "Indeed, this body of mine, too, is of the same nature; it will become like that; it cannot escape such a fate."

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body... Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body.

     - **Perception of the True Nature of the Sensation**
       
       380. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on sensation, vedanā?\ [BpitFn044]_

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu who follows my Teaching, when experiencing a pleasant sensation, knows that a pleasant sensation is experienced; or when experiencing an unpleasant sensation, knows that an unpleasant sensation is experienced; or when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant, knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant is experienced.

       When experiencing a pleasant sensation associated with sensual desires, he knows that a pleasant sensation associated with sensual desires is experienced; or when experiencing a pleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires, he knows that a pleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires is experienced; when experiencing an unpleasant sensation associated with sensual desires, he knows that an unpleasant sensation associated with sensual desires is experienced; or when experiencing an unpleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires, he knows that an unpleasant sensation not associated with sensual desires is experienced; when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant associated with sensual desires, he knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant associated with sensual desires is experienced; or when experiencing a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant not associated with sensual desires, he knows that a sensation neither pleasant nor unpleasant not associated with sensual desires is experienced.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation, vedanā experienced by himself.\ [BpitFn045]_ Occasionally he realizes that sensation experienced by others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on sensation experienced by others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on sensation experienced by himself or by others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of sensation. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of sensation. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of sensation, with their causes.\ [BpitFn046]_ And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only sensation.\ [BpitFn047]_ That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on sensation perceiving its true nature.

       如此，他安住於觀照內在的心為心、安住於觀照外在的心為心或安住於觀照內在與外在的心為心。他安住於觀照心的生起現象、安住於觀照心的壞滅現象或安住於觀照心的生起與壞滅現象。或者他建立起『有心』的正念只為了更高的智慧與正念。他獨立地安住，不執著世間的任何事物。諸比丘，這就是比丘安住於觀心為心的方法。

     - _`Contemplation of the Mind`

       381. And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind?
       
       Here, monks, a monk when a mind **has passion** knows “the mind has passion”,\ [AFn41]_
       
       | or when a mind is **without passion** he knows “the mind is without passion”;\ [AFn42]_
       | or when a mind **has hate** he knows “the mind has hate”,
       | or when a mind is **without hate** he knows “the mind is without hate”;
       | or when a mind **has delusion** he knows “the mind has delusion”,
       | or when a mind is **without delusion** he knows “the mind is without delusion”;
       | or when a mind is **collected** he knows “the mind is collected”, 
       | 
       | or when a mind is **scattered** he knows “the mind is scattered”;\ [AFn43]_
       | or when a mind has **become very great** he knows “the mind has become very great”,
       | or when a mind has **not become very great** he knows “the mind has not become very great”;\ [AFn44]_
       | or when a mind is **surpassable** he knows “the mind is surpassable”,
       | or when a mind is **unsurpassable** he knows “the mind is unsurpassable”;
       | or when a mind is **concentrated** he knows “the mind is concentrated”,
       | or when a mind is **not concentrated** he knows “the mind is not concentrated”;\ [AFn45]_
       | or when a mind is **liberated** he knows “the mind is liberated”,
       | or when a mind is **not liberated** he knows “the mind is not liberated”.\ [AFn46]_
       | 

       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind in regard to himself, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the mind in the mind in regard to himself and in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in the mind, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in the mind, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in the mind, or else mindfulness that “there is a mind” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness, and he dwells independent, and without being attached to anything in the world.

       In this way, monks, a monk dwells contemplating the (the nature of) the mind in the mind.

     - **Perception of the True Nature of Mind**
       
       381. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu concentrate steadfastly on the mind?\ [BpitFn048]_

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching knows\ [BpitFn049]_ the mind accompanied by passion,\ [BpitFn050]_ as 'Mind with passion'; he knows the mind unaccompanied by passion, as 'Mind without passion'; he also knows the mind accompanied by anger,\ [BpitFn051]_ as 'Mind with anger'; he also knows the mind unaccompanied by anger, as 'Mind without anger'; he also knows the mind accompanied by bewilderment,\ [BpitFn052]_ as 'Mind with bewilderment'; he also knows the mind unaccompanied by bewilderment, as 'Mind without bewilderment'; he also knows the indolent state of mind,\ [BpitFn053]_ as 'Indolent state of mind'; he also knows the distracted state of mind,\ [BpitFn054]_ as 'Distracted state of mind'; he also knows the developed state of mind,\ [BpitFn055]_ as 'Developed state of mind'; he also knows the undeveloped state of mind,\ [BpitFn056]_ as 'Undeveloped state of mind': he also knows the inferior state of mind, as 'Inferior state of mind'; he also knows the superior state of mind,\ [BpitFn057]_ as 'Superior state of mind'; he also knows the mind in a state of concentration,\ [BpitFn058]_ as 'Mind in a state of concentration'; he also knows the mind not in a state of concentration,\ [BpitFn059]_ as 'Mind not in a state of concentration'; he also knows 'the liberated state of mind,\ [BpitFn060]_ as 'Liberated state of mind'; he also knows the unliberated state of mind,\ [BpitFn061]_ as 'Unliberated state of mind'.

       Thus the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on his own mind.\ [BpitFn062]_ Occasionally he realizes that the mind of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to concentrate steadfastly on the mind of others. In this way, he is considered to concentrate steadfastly on his own mind or on the mind of others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the mind. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the mind. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the mind, with their causes.\ [BpitFn063]_ And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only Mind (without soul or atta). That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu concentrates steadfastly on the mind perceiving its true nature.

       **[End of "Perception of the True Nature of Mind"]**

   * - 英譯(Translated from the Pali by Ven. Thanissaro Bhikkhu)\ [8]_
     - **(C. Mind)**

       381. "And how does a monk remain focused on the mind in & of itself? There is the case where a monk, when the mind has passion, discerns that the mind has passion. When the mind is without passion, he discerns that the mind is without passion. When the mind has aversion, he discerns that the mind has aversion. When the mind is without aversion, he discerns that the mind is without aversion. When the mind has delusion, he discerns that the mind has delusion. When the mind is without delusion, he discerns that the mind is without delusion.

       "When the mind is restricted, he discerns that the mind is restricted. When the mind is scattered, he discerns that the mind is scattered. When the mind is enlarged, he discerns that the mind is enlarged. When the mind is not enlarged, he discerns that the mind is not enlarged. When the mind is surpassed, he discerns that the mind is surpassed. When the mind is unsurpassed, he discerns that the mind is unsurpassed. When the mind is concentrated, he discerns that the mind is concentrated. When the mind is not concentrated, he discerns that the mind is not concentrated. When the mind is released, he discerns that the mind is released. When the mind is not released, he discerns that the mind is not released.

       "In this way he remains focused internally on the mind in & of itself, or externally on the mind in & of itself, or both internally & externally on the mind in & of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the mind, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to the mind. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a mind' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the mind in & of itself.

   * - 英譯(Translated from the Pali by Ven. Bhikkhu Anālayo)\ [9]_
     - **[MIND]**

       381. “And how, monks, does he in regard to the mind abide contemplating the mind?
       
       “Here he knows a lustful mind to be ‘lustful’, and a mind without lust to be ‘without lust’; he knows an angry mind to be ‘angry’, and a mind without anger to be ‘without anger’; he knows a deluded mind to be ‘deluded’, and a mind without delusion to be ‘without delusion’; he knows a contracted mind to be ‘contracted’, and a distracted mind to be ‘distracted’; he knows a great mind to be ‘great’, and a narrow mind to be ‘narrow’; he knows a surpassable mind to be ‘surpassable’, and an unsurpassable mind to be ‘unsurpassable’; he knows a concentrated mind to be ‘concentrated’, and an unconcentrated mind to be unconcentrated’; he knows a liberated mind to be ‘liberated’, and an unliberated mind to be ‘unliberated.’
       
       **[REFRAIN]**
       
       “In this way, in regard to the mind he abides contemplating the mind internally … externally … internally and externally. He abides contemplating the nature of arising…of passing away…of both arising and passing away in regard to the mind. Mindfulness that ‘there is a mind’ is established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.
       
       “That is how in regard to the mind he abides contemplating the mind.

       **1. SECTION ON THE HINDRANCES**

       382. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on dhamma, mental and physical phenomena?\ [BpitFn064]_ Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the mental phenomena of the five Hindrances.\ [BpitFn065]_ And how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the five Hindrances?\ [BpitFn066]_

       Bhikkhus, when sense-desire is present in him, the bhikkhu following my Teaching knows, 'There is sense-desire in me'; or when sense-desire is not present in him, he knows, 'There is no sense-desire in me'. Besides, he knows how the sense-desire which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the sense-desire that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded sense-desire will not arise in the future.

       When ill will is present in him, he knows 'There is ill will in me'; or when ill will is not present in him, he knows 'There is no ill will in me'. Besides, he knows that the ill will which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the ill will that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded ill-will will not arise in the future.

       When sloth and torpor are present in him, he knows 'There are sloth and torpor in me'; or when sloth and torpor are not present in him, he knows 'There are no sloth and torpor in me'. Besides, he knows that the sloth and torpor which have not yet arisen come to arise; and he knows that the sloth and torpor that have arisen come to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded sloth and torpor will not arise in the future.

       When distraction and worry are present in him, he knows 'There are distraction and worry in me'; or when distraction and worry are not present in him, he knows 'There are no distraction and worry in me'. Besides, he knows that the distraction and worry which have not yet arisen come to arise; and he knows that the distraction and worry that have arisen come to be discarded; and be knows that the discarded distraction and worry will not arise in the future.

       When doubt or wavering of the mind is present in him, he knows 'There is doubt in me'; or when doubt is not present in him, he knows 'There is no doubt in me'. Besides, he knows that the doubt which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the doubt that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded doubt will not arise in the future.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn067]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma; in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma, with their causes.\ [BpitFn068]_ And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma.\ [BpitFn069]_ That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the five nivarana dhamma perceiving its true nature.

And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the five hindrances? There is the case where, there being sensual desire present within, a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me.' Or, there being no sensual desire present within, he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present within me.' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire. And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen. And he discerns how there is no future arising of sensual desire that has been abandoned. (The same formula is repeated for the remaining hindrances: ill will, sloth & drowsiness, restlessness & anxiety, and uncertainty.)

       "In this way he remains focused internally on mental qualities in & of themselves, or externally on mental qualities in & of themselves, or both internally & externally on mental qualities in & of themselves. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to mental qualities. Or his mindfulness that 'There are mental qualities' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the five hindrances.

Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma;.

       384. Moreover, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the six internal and external sense-spheres.\ [AFn54]_
       
       And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the six internal and external sense-spheres?
       
       Here, monks, a monk knows the **eye**, and he knows **forms**; and the fetter\ [AFn55]_ that arises dependent on the pair of them\ [AFn56]_ – that also he knows.
       
       How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future\ [AFn57]_ – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **ear**, and he knows **sounds**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **nose**, and he knows **smells**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **tongue**, and he knows **tastes**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **body**, and he knows **tangibles**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **mind**, and he knows **thoughts**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       \* * *
       
       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself and in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in things, or else mindfulness that “there are these (various) things” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness, and he dwells independent, and without being attached to anything in the world.
       
       In this way, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the six internal and external sense-spheres.

       384. And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the mental and physical phenomena of the six internal and the six external ayatanas, sense-bases.\ [BpitFn074]_ Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the six internal and the six external ayatana dhamma?

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching is conscious of the eye, is also conscious of visible objects, and knows any fetter\ [BpitFn075]_ that arises dependent on both the eye and the visible object. Besides, he knows how a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the ear, is also conscious of sounds, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the ear and the sound. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the nose, is also conscious of odors, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the nose and the odor. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the tongue, is also conscious of tastes, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the tongue and the taste. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the body, is also conscious of tactual objects, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the body and the tactual object. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the mind, is also conscious of mind-objects, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the mind and the mind-object. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.\ [BpitFn076]_

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn077]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma;. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma with their causes.\ [BpitFn078]_ And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only Dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the six internal and six external āyatana dhammā perceiving its true nature.

       Here, monks, a monk having the **Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening** in himself knows “there is the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       Having the **Investigation of the (nature) of things**\ [AFn60]_ **factor of Complete Awakening** in himself he knows “there is the Investigation of the (nature) of things factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Investigation of the (nature) of things factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Investigation of the (nature) of things factor of Complete Awakening in myself”.

       Having the **Energy factor of Complete Awakening** in himself he knows “there is the Energy factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Energy factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Energy factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Energy factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Energy factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       Having the **Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening**\ [AFn62]_ in himself he knows “there is the Joy factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       Having the **Calmness**\ [AFn63]_ **factor of Complete Awakening** in himself he knows “there is the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Calmness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       Having the **Concentration factor of Complete Awakening** in himself he knows “there is the Concentration factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Concentration factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Concentration factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Concentration factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Concentration factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       Having the **Equanimity factor of Complete Awakening** in himself he knows “there is the Equanimity factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Equanimity factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Equanimity factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Equanimity factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Equanimity factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       \* * *
       
       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself and in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in things, or else mindfulness that “there are (various) things” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness, and he dwells independent, and without being attached to anything in the world.

And, bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the seven bojjhanga, and perceive their soulless nature?

       Bhikkhus, when the enlightenment-factor of Mindfulness,\ [BpitFn081]_ is present in him, the bhikkhu following my Teaching knows "sati-sambojjhaṅga is present in me"; or when sati-sambojjhanga is not present in him, he knows 'sati-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the sati-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise;\ [BpitFn082]_ and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing\ [BpitFn083]_ the arisen sati-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of investigative knowledge of phenomena,\ [BpitFn084]_ is present in him, he knows "dhammavicaya- sambojjhaṅga is present in me"; or when dhammavicaya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'dhamma Vicaya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the dhammavicaya-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen dhamma vicaya-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of effort,\ [BpitFn085]_ is present in him, he knows 'viriya-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when viriya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'viriya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the viriya-sambojjhaṅga which has not yet arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen viriya-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of delightful satisfaction,\ [BpitFn086]_ is present in him, he knows 'pīti-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when pīti-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'pīti-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the pīti-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen pīti-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of serenity,\ [BpitFn087]_ is present in him, he knows 'passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how the complete fulfillment in developing the arisen passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of concentration,\ [BpitFn088]_ is present in him, he knows 'samādhi- sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when samādhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'samādhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the samādhi-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how the complete fulfillment in developing the arisen samādhi-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment factor of equanimity,\ [BpitFn089]_ is present in him, he knows 'upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when upekkhā- sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn090]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma;. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma with their causes.\ [BpitFn091]_ And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only Dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the seven bojjhaṅgā perceiving its true nature.

     - **Exposition of the Noble Truth of the Origin of Dukkha**

       400. And, bhikkhus, what is the Noble Truth of the origin of dukkha? The origin of dukkha is the Craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth, and, accompanied by pleasure and passion, finds great delight in this or that existence, namely, Craving for pleasures of the senses,\ [BpitFn099]_ Craving for better existence, and Craving for non-existence. But, bhikkhus, when this Craving arises, where does it arise? When it establishes itself, where does it establish itself? When this Craving arises and establishes\ [BpitFn100]_ itself, it does so in the delightful and pleasurable characteristics of the upadanakkhandhas.\ [BpitFn101]_

       What are the delightful and pleasurable characteristics of the upadanakkhandhas?

       In the upadanakkhandhas, the eye has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable.

In the upadanakkhandhas, the tongue... In the upadanakkhandhas, the body... In the upadanakkhandhas, the mind has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving arises, it arises there; when it establishes itself, it establishes itself there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, visible objects... In the upadanakkhandhas, sounds... In the upadanakkhandhas, odors... In the upadanakkhandhas, tastes... In the upadanakkhandhas, tactual objects... In the upadanakkhandhas, mind-objects have the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving arises, it arises there; when it establishes itself, it establishes itself there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, eye-consciousness\ [BpitFn103]_ ... In the upadanakkhandhas, ear-consciousness... In the upadanakkhandhas, nose-consciousness... In the upadanakkhandhas, tongue-consciousness... In the upadanakkhandhas, body-consciousness... In the upadanakkhandhas, mind-consciousness has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable.

     - The Truth of Cessation

       401. And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering?
       
       It is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving - liberation, letting go, release, and non-adherence.
       
       Now where, monks, is that craving when it is being abandoned (actually) abandoned? When ceasing where does it cease?
       
       In the world there is that which is likeable and pleasing - here this craving when it is being abandoned is abandoned, here when ceasing it ceases.
       
       And in the world what is likeable and pleasing?
       
       In the world **the eye** is likeable and pleasing - here this craving when it is being abandoned is abandoned, here when ceasing it ceases.
       
       In the world **the ear** is likeable and pleasing - here this craving when it is being abandoned is abandoned, here when ceasing it ceases.

       In the world **the nose** is likeable and pleasing - here this craving when it is being abandoned is abandoned, here when ceasing it ceases.

     - **Exposition of the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha**
       
       401. And, bhikkhus, what is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha? It is the complete extinction and cessation of this very Craving, its abandoning and discarding, the liberation and detachment from it.\ [BpitFn108]_

       But, bhikkhus, when this Craving is abandoned, where is it abandoned? When it ceases, where does it cease? When this Craving is abandoned or ceases, it is abandoned, or it ceases in the delightful and pleasurable characteristics of the upadanakkhandhas.

       What are the delightful and pleasurable characteristics of the upadanakkhandhas?

       In the upadanakkhandhas, the eye has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there;\ [BpitFn109]_ when it ceases, it ceases there. In the upadanakkhandhas, the ear... In the upadanakkhandhas, the nose... In the upadanakkhandhas, the tongue... In the upadanakkhandhas, the body... In the upadanakkhandhas, the mind has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, visible objects... In the upadanakkhandhas, sounds... In the upadanakkhandhas, odors... In the upadanakkhandhas, tastes... In the upadanakkhandhas, tactual objects... In the upadanakkhandhas, mind-objects have the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, the sensation born of eye-contact, the sensation born of ear-contact, the sensation born of nose-contact, the sensation born of tongue-contact. the sensation born of body-contact, the sensation born of mind-contact, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, perception of visible objects, perception of sounds, perception of odors, perception of tastes, perception of tactual objects, perception of mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when It ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, volition focused on visible objects, volition focused on sounds, volition focused on odors, volition focused on tastes, volition focused on tactual objects, volition focused on mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, Craving for visible objects, Craving for sounds, Craving for odors, Craving for tastes, Craving for tactual objects, Craving for mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, It is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, vitakka, initial application of the mind to visible objects, to sounds to odors, to tastes, to tactual objects, to mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, It is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, vicara, sustained application of the mind to visible objects, to sounds, to odors, to tastes, to tactual objects, to mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       Bhikkhus, this is called the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha.

       402. And, bhikkhus, what is the Noble Truth of the Path leading to the Cessation of Dukkha? It is the Noble Path of Eight Constituents, namely; Right View, Right Thinking, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right View? Insight-knowledge of dukkha, Insight-knowledge of the origin of dukkha, Insight-knowledge of the cessation of dukkha,\ [BpitFn110]_ Insight-knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of dukkha.\ [BpitFn111]_ This, bhikkhus, is called Right View.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Thinking? Thoughts directed to liberation from sensuality, thoughts free from ill will,\ [BpitFn112]_ and thoughts free from cruelty.\ [BpitFn113]_ This, bhikkhus, is called Right Thinking.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Speech? Abstaining from falsehood, from back-biting, from coarse speech, from vain and unbeneficial talk. This, bhikkhus, is called Right Speech.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Action? Abstaining from killing, from taking what is not given, from wrongful indulgence in sensual pleasures. This, bhikkhus, is called Right Action.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Livelihood? Bhikkhus, the ariya disciple following my Teaching completely abstains from a wrong way of livelihood, and makes his living by a right means of livelihood. This, bhikkhus, is called Right Livelihood.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Effort'? Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to prevent the arising of evil demeritorious states of mind that have not yet arisen. He generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to abandon evil demeritorious states of mind that have arisen. He generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to attain meritorious states of mind that have not yet arisen. He generates will, makes effort, rouses energy, applies his mind, and strives most ardently to maintain the meritorious states of mind that have arisen, to prevent their lapsing, to increase them, to cause them to grow, to make them develop in full.\ [BpitFn114]_ This, bhikkhus, is called Right Effort.

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Mindfulness?

       And, bhikkhus, what is Right Concentration?

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu who follows my Teaching, being detached from sensual pleasures and demetitorious factors, achieves and remains in the first jhana, which has initial application of the mind, sustained application of the, mind, delightful satisfaction and bliss, born of detachment from the hindrances.

       Having got rid of vitakka and vicara, the bhikkhu achieves and remains in the second jhana, with internal tranquillity, with enhancement of one-pointedness of Concentration, devoid of vitakka and vicara, but with piti and sukha born of Concentration.

       Having been detached from piti, that bhikkhu dwells in equanimity with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and experiences sukha in mind and body. He achieves and remains in the third jhana, that which causes a person who attains it to be praised by the Noble Ones as one who has equanimity and mindfulness, one who abides in sukhas.

       "And what is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the cessation of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: This is called right view.

       "And what is right resolve? Aspiring to renunciation, to freedom from ill will, to harmlessness: This is called right resolve.

       "And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, & from idle chatter: This is called right speech.

       "And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from stealing, & from illicit sex. This is called right action.

       "And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This is called right livelihood.

       "And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds & exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen... (and) for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, & culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This is called right effort.

       "And what is right mindfulness? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in & of themselves... the mind in & of itself... mental qualities in & of themselves — ardent, alert, & mindful — putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world. This is called right mindfulness.

       "And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities — enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation — internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress — he enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called right concentration.

He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma, with their causes. And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating.

       世尊說了這。那些滿意的諸比丘，全然歡喜世尊之所說。

   * - 漢譯(帕奧禪師弟子合譯)\ [5]_
     - 405. 這就是為什麼說：『諸比丘，這是使眾生清淨、超越憂愁與悲傷、滅除痛苦與憂惱、成就正道與現證涅槃的單一道路，那就是四念處。』」
       
       世尊如此開示之後，諸比丘對世尊的話感到愉悅與歡喜。

   * - 英譯(Translated from the Pali by Ven. Ānandajoti Bhikkhu)\ [6]_ 
     - 405. This is a one-way path, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of grief and lamentation, for the extinction of pain and sorrow, for attaining the right way, for the direct realisation of Nibbāna, that is to say, the four ways of attending to mindfulness. Thus, whatever was said, it is for this reason it was said.”

       The Gracious One said this,

       and those monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Gracious One.

       **The Advantages of Developing the Ways of Attending to Mindfulness is Finished**
       
       **The Long Discourse about the Ways of Attending to Mindfulness is Finished**

   * - 英譯(Translated from the Pali by Burma Piṭaka Association)\ [7]_
     - 405. Because of these beneficial results, I have declared at the beginning thus: "Bhikkhus, this is the one and only way for the purification of the minds of beings, for overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the complete destruction of physical pain and mental distress, for attainment of the noble Ariya Magga, and for the realization of Nibbāna. That only way is the practice of the four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness."

       Thus spoke the Bhagava. Delighted, the bhikkhus received the words of the Buddha with respectful appreciation.

   * - 英譯(Translated from the Pali by Ven. Thanissaro Bhikkhu)\ [8]_
     - 405. "'This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow & lamentation, for the disappearance of pain & distress, for the attainment of the right method, & for the realization of Unbinding — in other words, the four frames of reference.' Thus was it said, and in reference to this was it said."

       That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.

   * - 英譯(Translated from the Pali by Ven. Bhikkhu Anālayo)\ [9]_
     - 405. So it was with reference to this that it was said:

       **[DIRECT PATH]**

       “Monks, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of dukkha and discontent, for acquiring the true method, for the realization of Nibbãna, namely, the four satipaììhãnas.”
       
       That is what the Blessed One said. The monks were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.

   * - 漢譯(香光書鄉編譯組，無著尊者 著)\ [10]_
     - 405. 因此，所宣說的正是關於這一點：
       **直接之道**

       「比丘們啊！這是直接之道─為了眾生的清淨；為了憂傷和悲歎的超越；為了苦和不滿的滅除；為了正理的成就；為了涅槃的證悟─就是，四念住。」
       
       這是世尊所宣說的。
       
       比丘們對於世尊所言，滿意且歡喜。

.. [ChngFn01] 〔莊　註01〕　「如是我聞(SA/DA)；我聞如是(MA)；聞如是(AA)」，南傳作「我聽到這樣」(Evaṃ me sutaṃ，直譯為「這樣被我聽聞」，忽略文法則為「如是-我-聞」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「我聽到這樣」(Thus have I heard)。 「如是我聞……歡喜奉行。」的經文格式，依印順法師的考定，這樣的格式，應該是在《增一阿含》或《增支部》成立的時代才形成的(參看《原始佛教聖典之集成》p.9)，南傳《相應部》多數經只簡略地指出發生地點，應該是比較早期的風貌。

.. [ChngFn02] 〔莊　註02〕　「一時」，南傳作「有一次」(ekaṃ samayaṃ，直譯為「一時」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「有一次」(On one occasion)。

.. [ChngFn03] 〔莊　註03〕　「世尊；眾祐」(bhagavā，音譯為「婆伽婆；婆伽梵；薄伽梵」，義譯為「有幸者」，古譯為「尊祐」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「幸福者」(the Blessed One)。請參看〈世尊譯詞的探討〉

.. [ChngFn04] 〔莊　註04〕　「比丘；苾芻」(bhikkhu，義譯為「乞食者」) ，女性音譯為「比丘尼」(bhikkhunī)，菩提比丘長老英譯照錄不譯。按：「比丘」即「乞食」(bhikkha)的「稱呼語態」，而「乞食者」(bhikkhaka)為「乞食」的「形容詞化」，「比丘」與「乞食者」在通俗話語中是同義詞，但佛教僧團中「比丘」有其特定的附加條件與意義，而成為「比丘」是「乞食者」，但「乞食者」不一定都是「比丘」的情況。

.. [ChngFn05] 〔莊　註05〕　「尊師！」(bhadante, bhaddante，另譯為「大德！」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「值得尊敬的尊長」(Venerable sir)。

.. [ChngFn06] 〔莊　註06〕　「一乘道(SA)；一道(MA/AA)；唯有一道(GA)」，南傳作「無岔路之道」(Ekāyano……maggo)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「單行道」(the one-way path)，並解說，此詞常被譯為「唯一之道」(the only way, the sole way)，意味著這是佛陀獨有之道(an exclusive path)，但註釋書只說，這不是一個分支道路(na dvedhāpathabhūto，不成為歧道)。此詞在《中部12經》清楚地表示，其意思是「直通目的地之路」(a path leading straight to its destination，譯者按：原文為工具格的「ekāyanena maggena」，相當的《增壹阿含50品6經》該段譯作：「若有人直從一道來，有目之士見已便知之，斯人所趣向，定至此樹不疑。」即譯為「一道」)，也許這是比對其它總是無法直通目的地的禪法而說的。又，此詞不應與《妙法蓮華經(法華經)》(the Saddharma Puṇḍarika Satra)中心主題的「一乘」(ekayāna)混淆。按：檢視漢譯阿含經中稱「一乘道」或「一道」的法門，還有「六念」(\ `《雜阿含550經》 <http://agama.buddhason.org/SA/SA0550.htm>`__ \)、「四如意足」(\ `《雜阿含561經》 <http://agama.buddhason.org/SA/SA0561.htm>`__ \)、「戒定慧」(\ `《雜阿含563經》 <http://agama.buddhason.org/SA/SA0563.htm>`__ \)、「正定」(\ `《中阿含189經》 <http://agama.buddhason.org/MA/MA189.htm>`__ \)等，不只是「四念住」而已，這與菩提比丘長老不贊成將之譯為「唯一之道」的觀點相順。另外\ `《雜阿含962經》 <http://agama.buddhason.org/SA/SA0962.htm>`__ \ 佛陀沒有「這才正確，其它都錯。」的觀念，也可參考。

.. [ChngFn07] 〔莊　註07〕　「四意止；四念處；四念住」(cattāro satipaṭṭhānā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「四個深切注意的建立」(four establishments of mindfulness)，並解說「satipaṭṭhāna」一詞，論師們有兩種解讀法，若解讀為「念+現起」(sati + upaṭṭhāna)，則為「念住；深切注意的建立」，若解讀為「念+出發點」(sati + paṭṭhāna)，則為「念處；深切注意的基礎」，前者強調「建立念的行為」，後者強調「應用念的所緣」，雖然論師多傾向後者，但前者確定是更原始的。

.. [ChngFn08] 〔莊　註08〕　「身身觀念處；身身觀住；住身念處；觀身如身；觀內身如身；內身觀」，南傳作「住於在自己的身上隨觀身」(ajjhattaṃ kāye kāyānupassī viharati，逐字直譯為「內-身-身+隨觀-住」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「住於在內在的身體凝視著身體」(dwells contemplating the body in the body internally)，並解說「在身上隨觀身」(kāye kāyānupassī)是「以將之從其它隔離(如受、心等)，決定所緣(身)」(“to determine the object (the body) by isolating it” from other things such as feeling, mind, etc.)，「凝視著身只是身而已，不是常、樂、我、淨(美)」(one contemplates only the body as such, not as permanent, pleasurable, a self, or beautiful)，其它「受」、「心」、「法」亦同。



.. [ChngFn09] 〔莊　註09〕　「安那般那念(SA)；修息出息入(MA)；念安般(AA)」，南傳作「入出息念」(ānāpānassati，另譯為「出入息念」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「呼吸的深切注意」(Mindfulness of breathing)。按：「入出息」(ānāpāna)，音譯為「安那般那」，簡為「安般」，亦譯為「呼吸」。

.. [ChngFn10] 〔莊　註10〕　「身身觀念處；身身觀住；住身念處；觀身如身；觀內身如身；內身觀」，南傳作「住於在自己的身上隨觀身」(ajjhattaṃ kāye kāyānupassī viharati，逐字直譯為「內-身-身+隨觀-住」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「住於在內在的身體凝視著身體」(dwells contemplating the body in the body internally)，並解說「在身上隨觀身」(kāye kāyānupassī)是「以將之從其它隔離(如受、心等)，決定所緣(身)」(“to determine the object (the body) by isolating it” from other things such as feeling, mind, etc.)，「凝視著身只是身而已，不是常、樂、我、淨(美)」(one contemplates only the body as such, not as permanent, pleasurable, a self, or beautiful)，其它「受」、「心」、「法」亦同。 

.. [ChngFn11] 〔莊　註11〕　「繫念面前(SA)；正願(MA)；繫念在前(AA)」，南傳作「建立起面前的正念後」(parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「在他面前建立深切注意」(set up mindfulness in front of him, establishing mindfulness before him)，並引《清淨道論》的解說，「面前的正念」是指「在鼻尖上或在上唇中心上」(at the tip of the nose or at the centre of the upper lip)。 
 
.. [ChngFn12] 〔莊　註12〕　「他只正念地吸氣」(So satova assasati)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「他只深切注意的吸氣」(just mindful he breathes in, SN.54.1, ever mindful he breathes in,MN.119)。「吸氣」(assasati)，水野弘元《巴利語辭典》譯作「出息(呼氣)」，反之，「呼氣」(passasati)，水野弘元《巴利語辭典》譯作「入息(吸氣)」，並加註「本來是出息(呼氣)」。

.. [ChngFn13] 〔莊　註013〕　「覺知一切身(SA)；學一切身(MA)」，南傳作「感受著一切身」(sabbakāyappaṭisaṃvedī)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「體驗著全身」(experiencing the whole body)，並在SN.54.1的註解中引《清淨道論》的解說：知道、明白吸氣身的開端、中間與結束。按：「感受」(paṭisaṃvedī)，另譯為「經驗；察覺」。

.. [ChngFn14] 〔莊　註14〕　「一切身行息；身行休息(SA)；學止身行(MA)」，南傳作「使身行寧靜著」(passambhayaṃ kāyasaṅkhāraṃ)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「使身體的形成(身行)寧靜」(tranquillising the bodily formation)，並在SN.54.1的註解中引《清淨道論》的解說：「身行」是指「呼吸本身」(the in-and-out breathing itself)。按：SN.41.6說：「入息出息是身行。」

.. [ChngFn15] 〔莊　註15〕　「隨觀」(anupassi)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「凝視；熟視；注視」(contemplating)。

.. [ChngFn16] 〔莊　註16〕　「集法」(samudayadhammo)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「屬於有起源者」(subject to origination)，或「起源性質」(the nature of origination, SN.47.40)。這裡的「法」不是指「正法」。

.. [ChngFn17] 〔莊　註17〕　「為了智與憶念的程度」(ñāṇamattāya paṭissatimattāya)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「為僅夠的理解與深切注意」(for bare knowledge and mindfulness)。

.. [ChngFn18] 〔莊　註18〕　「有身體」(Atthi kāyoti )，菩提比丘長老英譯為「有身體」(there is a body)。

.. [ChngFn19] 〔莊　註19〕　「正知於行為者」(sampajānakārī，逐字直譯為「正知+作者」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「以清楚的理解而行動者」(who acts with clear comprehension)。

.. [ChngFn20] 〔莊　註20〕　「大衣」(saṅghāṭi，音譯為「僧伽梨；僧迦梨；僧迦利」，另譯為「重衣」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「外衣」(outer robe)。

.. [ChngFn21] 〔莊　註21〕　「如其住立、如其志向、有界之身」(kāyaṃ yathāṭhitaṃ yathāpaṇihitaṃ dhātuso)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「就此身，無論被安置，無論其傾向，為元素組成」(this same body, however it is placed, however disposed, as consisting of elements, MN.10/119)。

.. [ChngFn22] 〔莊　註22〕　「息道；息止道」，南傳作「在墓地」(sivathikāya，疑為sīvathikāya之訛，另譯為「在墓所；在塚間」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「在棄屍地」(in a charnel ground)。



.. [ChngFn23] 〔莊　註23〕　「樂食」(MA)，「食樂痛」(AA)，南傳作「肉體的樂受」(sāmisaṃ vā sukhaṃ vedanaṃ)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「肉體的快樂感受」(carnal pleasant feeling, SN.36.14)。按：「肉體的」(sāmisa)，另譯為「有味的；有食味的；物質的；塗滿食物的；有物質的」。

.. [ChngFn24] 〔莊　註24〕　「樂無食」(MA)，「不食樂痛」(AA)，南傳作「精神的樂受」(nirāmisāpi sukhā vedanā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「精神上的快樂感受」(spiritual pleasant feeling)。按：「精神的」(nirāmisa)，另譯為「無食味的；無染汚的；離財的；無肉的；無欲望的；無實質性的；離物質的；非物質的」。



.. [ChngFn25] 〔莊　註25〕　「五蓋」(pañca nīvaraṇā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「五個障礙」(the five hindrances)。

.. [ChngFn26] 〔莊　註26〕　「欲欲；貪欲」，南傳作「欲的意欲」(kāmacchandaṃ)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「感官的想要；肉慾的想要」(sensual desire)。

.. [ChngFn27] 〔莊　註27〕　「五受陰；五盛陰」，南傳作「五取蘊」(pañcannaṃ upādānakkhandhānaṃ, pañcupādānakkhandhā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「所執著的五個集合體」(five aggregates subject to clinging)，這裡漢譯的「受」顯然是「取；執取」(upādāna)的另譯。「陰」，漢譯另也譯為「蘊」、「犍度」(khandha)，南傳作「蘊」(khandhe)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「集合體」(aggregates)。

.. [ChngFn28] 〔莊　註28〕　「集；集起」(samudaya，動詞samudayati)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「起源，起來；出現」(origin, origination(動詞originate), arising)。

.. [ChngFn31] 〔莊　註31〕　「念覺分；念覺支；念覺意(DA/AA)」(satisambojjhaṅgo，另譯為「念等覺分」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「深切注意的開化要素」(the enlightenment factor of mindfulness)。

.. [ChngFn32] 〔莊　註32〕「修習」(bhāveti，原意為「使有；使存在」， 名詞bhāvanā，特別用在禪修的場合)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「開發；發展」(develops, 名詞development)，或「默想的開發；禪修」(meditative development, AN.8.36)。

.. [ChngFn33] 〔莊　註33〕　「擇法覺分；法覺意(DA/AA)；擇法覺支」(dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo，另譯為「擇法等覺分」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「狀態之識別的開化要素」(the enlightenment factor of discrimination of states)。

.. [ChngFn43] 〔莊　註43〕　「命根閉塞」(MA)，南傳作「命根斷絕」(jīvitindriyassupacchedo)，菩提比丘長老英譯均缺，「命根」(jīvitindriya)則英譯為「生命的器官機能」(life faculty)，Thanissaro比丘英譯為「生命的器官機能的中斷」(interruption in the life faculty)，緬甸三藏協會英譯為「生命的器官機能的破壞」(the destruction of the life-faculty)。

.. [ChngFn45] 〔莊　註45〕　「生法」(jātidhammo)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「屬於出生者」(subject to birth)。

.. [ChngFn46] 〔莊　註46〕　「當來有愛(SA)；當來有樂欲；愛樂彼彼有起；未來有愛；此愛當受未來有(MA)」，南傳作「導致再生的渴愛」(taṇhāya ponobbhavikāya，ponobhavikā為punabbhava的形容詞化，直譯為「再有的」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「導向重新存在」(that leads to renewed existence)。「貪喜俱」(SA)、「喜欲共俱；與喜欲俱」(MA)，南傳作「伴隨歡喜與貪」(nandirāgasahagatā，直譯為「喜貪共行」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「由歡樂與慾望陪同」(accompanied by delight and lust)。「彼彼樂著」(SA)、「共俱求彼彼有；愛樂彼彼有起；願彼彼有」(MA)，南傳作「到處歡喜」(tatratatrābhinandinī，直譯為「彼彼歡喜」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「到處尋歡樂」(seeking delight here and there)。

.. [ChngFn51] 〔莊　註51〕　「色之思」(Rūpasañcetanā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「對色的意志力」(volition regarding forms, SN.25.7)。

.. [ChngFn52] 〔莊　註52〕　「色之渴愛」(Rūpataṇhā The craving for sights)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「對色的渴愛」(craving for forms, SN.25.8)。

.. [ChngFn53] 〔莊　註53〕　「色之尋」(Rūpavitakko)，Maurice Walshe先生英譯為「景色的『想』」('Thinking' of sights, DN.22)。

.. [ChngFn57] 〔莊　註57〕　「無依住」(anālaya，另譯為「無執著；非住；非阿賴耶」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「拒絕那同一個渴愛」(rejecting of that same craving)或「不依靠它」(non-reliance on it, SN.22.103)。

.. [ChngFn67] 〔莊　註67〕　「邪淫(婬)」(kāmesumicchācārā，直譯為「欲邪行；在欲上-邪(錯誤)-行」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「性行為不檢；通姦」(sexual misconduct)或「在感官快樂上的行為不檢」(misconduct in sensual pleasures)。

.. [ChngFn68] 〔莊　註68〕　「多聞聖弟子」，南傳作「已受教導的聖弟子」(sutavā ariyasāvaka)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「已受教導之高潔的弟子」(the instructed noble disciple)。其中之「多聞」不只是「多聽」而已，應該含有受教導而實踐的意義，所以譯為「已受教導」。而「聖」(ariya，梵語ārya)，與「雅利安人」(梵語aryans)之「雅利安」顯然同字，「雅利安人」為印歐族白種人，遷居入印度後，以高貴人種自居，也許是這個字的來源。在佛教中，「聖弟子」多指證入初果以上的聖者，但有時也泛指一般佛陀弟子。 

.. [ChngFn69] 〔莊　註69〕　「具足住(SA)；成就遊(MA)；自遊戲；自娛樂；自遊化(DA/AA)」，南傳作「進入後住於」(upasampajja viharanti，逐字直譯為「具足住」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「進入及住在」(enter and dwell in)。

.. [ChngFn70] 〔莊　註70〕　「有覺、有觀(覺觀)；與覺、觀俱」，南傳作「有尋、有伺」(savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「被想法與檢查陪同」(is accompanied by thought and examination)。

.. [ChngFn71] 〔莊　註71〕　「離生喜、樂」，南傳作「離而生喜、樂」(vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「帶著隔離所生的狂喜與快樂」(with rapture and happiness born of seclusion)。

.. [ChngFn72] 〔莊　註72〕　「一心；心得一(MA)」，南傳作「心一境性」(cittassa ekaggatā, cittekaggatā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「心的統一」(unification of mind)，或「一心」(cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「心的統一」(unification of mind, SN.36.31)，或「心一境」(ekaggacitto)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「心是統一的」(mind is unified, MN.29)。

.. [ChngFn73] 〔莊　註73〕　「捨淨念(SA)；捨念清淨(MA)；護念清淨(DA/AA)」，南傳作「由平靜而正念遍淨」(upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ，逐字直譯為「捨(平靜)+念+清淨(遍淨)」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「包括以平靜而潔淨的深切注意」(includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity, SN)，或「由平靜而純淨的深切注意」(purity of mindfulness due to equanimity, MN)，或「有以平靜而潔淨的深切注意」(which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity, AN)。



.. [ChngFn74] 〔莊　註74〕　「所得智」(MA.187)，南傳作「完全智」(aññā, aññaṃ，另譯為「了知；開悟；已知」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「最終的理解」(final knowledge)。按：「完全智」與「究竟智」(sammadaññā)的意思似乎是等同的(菩提比丘長老的英譯是相同的)，北傳多譯為「究竟智」。

.. [ChngFn75] 〔莊　註75〕　「有餘」(MA)，南傳作「有餘依；有殘餘」(upādisese, sa-upādisesaṃ，另譯為「有餘的」)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「有執著的殘渣」(there is a residue of clinging)，並解說這裡所譯的「執著」(clinging)，只為了表示上的清晰，而不是要以「取；執取」(upādāna)來取代「生命的燃料」(upādi)的意思，而此原慣用語的意思，只是單純「(未被指定的)殘渣」(an (unspecified) residue)的意思。

.. [ChngFn76] 〔莊　註76〕　「或有餘得阿那含(MA.98)」，南傳作「或當存在有餘依時，為不還者狀態」(sati vā upādisese anāgāmitā)，菩提比丘長老英譯為「或者，如果有執著的殘渣，不返回」(or if there is a trace of clinging left, non-return)或「或者，如果有執著的殘渣，不返回的狀態」(or, if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning, SN.48.65)。

.. [AFn01] (Ven. Anandajoti 01) The titles given in this edition are as they appear in ChS and Only (though Only omits this particular title), which have been extracted from the end titles, which are omitted in those editions. Headings being a modern convenience unknown to the manuscript tradition, BJT omits them, but includes the end-titles. In this edition both have been included for convenience on the one hand, and authenticity on the other.

.. [AFn02] (Ven. Anandajoti 02) *Kurūsu* is plural and means *amongst the Kurus*, or *amongst the Kuru people*, with the implication: *in the Kuru country*.

.. [AFn03] (Ven. Anandajoti 03) *Kammāssadammaṁ* is an accusative having locative meaning here; according to the commentary the accusative is used because there was no monastery *in* the town, and the Gracious One stayed in the jungle *nearby* (though quite why that should change the case is unclear, as the locative regularly means *near* or *nearby*).

.. [AFn04] (Ven. Anandajoti 04) Commonly translated as either *the only path* or as *the direct path*. Doctrinally the former has to be excluded as the Buddha taught many paths according to temperament; and *sammāsati* forms only one part of the Noble Eightfold Path; *the direct path* on the other hand is really an unfortunate paraphrase, as a one-way street may and may not go directly to its destination, as witness the one-way streets in our cities. Rather the phrase means simply *a one-way path*, as it is translated here, which makes perfect sense doctrinally (as well as linguistically), as the characteristic of all one-way paths is that there is no turning back, and they lead one on until eventually they reach the conclusion, which, in this case, as we will see at the end, is final knowledge (*aññā*), or the state of non-return (*anāgāmitā*).

.. [AFn05] (Ven. Anandajoti 05) In this compound *dukkha* means bodily pain as opposed to mental pain, *domanassa* or *sorrow*; but it should be clear that it also implies the ending of all suffering.

.. [AFn06] (Ven. Anandajoti 06) *Sacchi*- = *sa* (one’s own) *acchi* (eye); *with one’s own eyes*, *directly experiencing* or *realising*.

.. [AFn07] (Ven. Anandajoti 07) The correct parsing of *satipaṭṭhāna* is *sati* + *upaṭṭhāna* (cf. *smṛty-upasthāna* in BHS) which is recognized but rejected by the commentary, which favours the derivation from *sati* + *paṭṭhāna*. *Upaṭṭhāna* is derived from the verb *upaṭṭhāti* (itself a variant of *upatiṭṭhati*), and literally means *standing near*, therefore *attending on*, *serving*. Also related to *upaṭṭhāka*, an attendant (Ānanda was the Buddha’s main *upaṭṭhāka* in later years). The word *sati* is a feminine action-noun derived from the past participle of *sarati* the basic meaning of which is *remembers*. The translation of *sati* as *mindfulness* is something of a compromise, as *sati* doesn’t really mean simply *mindfulness*, which in normal English is synonymic with *carefulness*; but nor is it *simple awareness* or *bare attention*, rather the word seems to combine the two meanings and intends a careful sort of attention to whatever objects are arising in consciousness. If it wasn’t so cumbersome *reflective awareness* might be more indicative than *mindfulness*.

.. [AFn08] (Ven. Anandajoti 08) Comm: *here means in this Sāsana*; which seems to be a little narrow, as many people today appear to be practising mindfulness without being within the Sāsana of the Buddha, even though it remains doubtful how far along the path anyone can go without having attained to right view (*sammā diṭthi*).

.. [AFn09] (Ven. Anandajoti 09) Comm: **ardent** *means having (enough) ardour to burn away the defilements in the three realms of existence, this is a name for (strong) energy*.

.. [AFn10] (Ven. Anandajoti 10) *Vineyya* is an absolutive (comm: *vineyyā ti ... vinayitvā*), which is an infinite verbal form syntactically dependent on a finite verb (here *viharati*). An absolutive signifies that the action is completed (perfected) in the past before the time of the finite verb. *Vineyya* is sometimes translated as though it were a present participle: *removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world* (or some such translation); however, as far as I have ever seen, the logic of the absolutive grammatically always implies that the action is complete before the action of the main verb, no matter what idiom we use in translation.

.. [AFn11] (Ven. Anandajoti 11) Comm: *the world of his own body, the world of the five constituents that provide fuel for attachment*. The same sort of interpretation is to be applied below to the world of the three feelings, the world of the mind and the world of (the nature of) things.



.. [AFn12] (Ven. Anandajoti 12) The absolutives here and in the next line are connected with the finite verbs *assasati* and *passasati* (as in Ñāṇamoli’s translation of MN 10), and not with *nisīdati* in the preceding line, in which case the folding of the legs, setting the body straight, and establishment of mindfulness would all occur before he sat down!

.. [AFn13] (Ven. Anandajoti 13) *Parimukhaṁ* means *at the front*, or perhaps, *around the mouth*, i.e. it is a vague area, not meant to be confined to one particular spot or place, which would have been easy to designate if that is what was meant (like specifying *oṭṭha*, the lip). It is of course the mindfulness that is important in the practice, not the breathing as such, which only provides a basis for the mindfulness.

.. [AFn14] (Ven. Anandajoti 14) Paṭisambhidāmagga says: *body means the two bodies - the mind-body and the physical body*; this would seem to mitigate against breathing meditation being taken solely as a body-based meditation.

.. [AFn15] (Ven. Anandajoti 15) The instruction here changes from the present tense for *breathing* to the future tense. The reason for this change is that once the mind is settled on the breath he needs to deliberately cultivate mindfulness to progress further in the practice.

.. [AFn16] (Ven. Anandajoti 16) The choice of simile here is surely significant, as the turner knows not just *what* is happening, but *how he is making it happen*, so that knowledge of the intention is also included in the practice.

.. [AFn17] (Ven. Anandajoti 17) The context seems to indicate that *contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body* means contemplating the transient, ownerless nature of the body, as is signified by the references to origination and dissolution (*samudaya & vaya [= anicca]*) on the one hand; and the impersonal knowledge “there is a body” (atthi kāyo [= anattā]) on the other. *Suffering*, the other of the three characteristics of existence (*tilakkhaṇa*) is implied in *impermanence*. And similarly in regard to the other contemplations.

.. [AFn18] (Ven. Anandajoti 18) That we are really talking about others’ bodies, and not the internal and external parts of our own body, is confirmed by the Abhidhamma Satipaṭṭhānavibhaṅga (translated elsewhere on this website), where the grammar excludes any other interpretation.

.. [AFn19] (Ven. Anandajoti 19) See DP, *ajjhattaṁ* (and ° *bahiddhā*\) for these meanings. In Janavasabhasutta (DN 18,26) it says: *here ... a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body, ardent, with full awareness, mindfully aware, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; while he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body there he becomes perfectly concentrated, perfectly clear, and, being perfectly concentrated, perfectly clear, he generates knowledge and insight regarding the external bodies of others*. Similarly in regard to the contemplation of *feelings*, *mind*, and *the nature of things*.

.. [AFn20] (Ven. Anandajoti 20) The translation follows the commentary, which says: *just as far as, this designates, and is limited to, purpose. This is what is said: whatever mindfulness is established is not for another reason. Then the meaning of as far as (is necessary for) a measure of knowledge is so as to increase more and more, further and further, knowledge and mindfulness, for the increase of mindfulness and full awareness*. For the same word in Sanskrit having this meaning see SED under *mātra*. This seems to me to make much better sense than the usual translation of *for just knowledge and remembrance* (Way); or *for mere understanding and mere awareness* (VRI). See also MN 22, near the end, where *saddhamatta* is translated by Ñāṇamoḷi and Bodhi (MLDB) as *sufficient faith*, and *pemamatta* as *sufficient love*.

.. [AFn21] (Ven. Anandajoti 21) Comm: *he lives independent because he is not dependent on wrong views or craving*.

.. [AFn22] (Ven. Anandajoti 22) Comm: *he doesn’t grasp (anything) thinking: this is my self or this belongs to my self*.

.. [AFn23] (Ven. Anandajoti 23) This is where the idea that *sati* is *mere awareness* breaks down irretrievably, because as the commentary says: *even animals like dogs and jackals know they are going when they are going ... but they do not uproot the perception of a self and cannot be said to be attending to mindfulness or a (proper) meditation subject*. We see that mindfulness as taught here is always mindfulness of the true nature of reality, which is the liberating factor.

.. [AFn24] (Ven. Anandajoti 24) The reduplication of the adverb gives it a distributive sense, *in whatever way*.

.. [AFn25] (Ven. Anandajoti 25) Comm: *herein, there are four kinds of full awareness: full awareness of the purpose [of going], full awareness of the suitability [of going], full awareness of resort [where one is going], full awareness of non-delusion [while going]*.

.. [AFn26] (Ven. Anandajoti 26) This section emphasises that on all occasions during one’s daily life one can maintain mindfulness, as long as one keeps in mind the true nature of the body, and doesn’t cling to it, but that is only possible if one doesn’t get caught up in daily activities, and therefore forgetful of the nature of reality.

.. [AFn27] (Ven. Anandajoti 27) As noted in the Introduction it appears from the other versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna practice in the Pāḷi discourses and from comparative studies of the texts in the early traditions that this section on replulsiveness is the only original section in Kāyānupassanā, which means that the rest of the meditations described in the discourse are later additions, which gives it special relevance. It should also be noted that traditionally the subject for meditation (*kammaṭṭhāna*) described here (*hairs of the head, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin*, etc.) is the first subject given to a newly ordained monastic, and may be taken as an introduction to the practice of mindfulness right at the beginning of the monastic’s life.

.. [AFn28] (Ven. Anandajoti 28) Only adds *the brain*, here and in the repetition below, which is an addition to the formula made in Medieval times. The list up to this point is of the items that have a preponderance of the earth-element, the ones after this point have a preponderance of the water-element.

.. [AFn29] (Ven. Anandajoti 29) This is, of course, merely meant to be indicative of the sort of things found in the body, not a comprehensive list thereof, as can also be confirmed from the simile below where examples of grain are given, not a complete list of all known grains.

.. [AFn30] (Ven. Anandajoti 30) 1 A charnel ground is a place where bodies were left on the ground, sometimes elevated ground, to be devoured by animals or birds.

.. [AFn31] (Ven. Anandajoti 31) More exactly, *vinīlaka* means *blue-coloured*.

.. [AFn32] (Ven. Anandajoti 32) In most countries these days there are no charnel grounds and it is not so easy to find abandoned bodies to do this practice, so monks in Buddhist countries often visit morgues or dissection rooms in hospitals. If actual dead bodies are not available, it is always possible to use one’s imagination. The point of the exercise is not morbidity, but insight, so a degree of spiritual maturity and stability should be established before attempting the practice, which should preferably be done under the guidance of an experienced teacher. Monks in the time of the Buddha who did this practice without guidance started killing themselves (see the opening to Pārājika III in the Vinaya Suttavibhaṅga).

.. [AFn33] (Ven. Anandajoti 33) ChS has an expanded list, which includes *herons*, *tigers*, and *leopards*.

.. [AFn34] (Ven. Anandajoti 34) Literally: *scattered in the main and intermediate directions*.

.. [AFn35] (Ven. Anandajoti 35) There are many variations in the lists given in the various editions here. BJT adds: *ankle-bone*; *shoulder-bone*; *neck-bone* and *tooth-bone*. ChS is different in content and order, and also in spelling in some cases: *ankle-bone, rib-bone, shoulder-bone, neck-bone and jaw-bone*. Similar variations occur in Only which adds: *rib-bone, chest-bone, arm-bone, shoulder-bone, neck-bone, jaw-bone and tooth*.



.. [AFn36] (Ven. Anandajoti 36) To be parsed as *a-dukkhaṁ a-sukhaṁ*. Another word that is used for this is *upekkhā*, which is this context would mean *indifferent feeling*.

.. [AFn37] (Ven. Anandajoti 37) These are the three basic feelings that are enumerated in the teaching, what follows is a further division of these feelings depending on whether they are connected with sense-desire or not. Pleasant feelings that are not connected with sense-desire are recommended by the Buddha for loosening attachment to those that are so connected, see Saḷāyatanavibhaṅgasuttaṁ, MN 137.

.. [AFn38] (Ven. Anandajoti 38) Comm: **sensual pleasant** *and so on - sensual pleasant is a name for the five strands of sensuality dependent on the sensual, and the six happy feelings connected with the life of the householder; spiritual pleasant is a name for the six happy feelings connected with the life of renunciation*.

.. [AFn39] (Ven. Anandajoti 39) Comm: **sensual unpleasant** *is a name for the six sorrowful feelings connected with the life of the householder; spiritual unpleasant is a name for the six sorrowful feelings connected with the life of renunciation*.

.. [AFn40] (Ven. Anandajoti 40) Comm: **sensual neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant** *is a name for the six equanimous feelings connected with the life of the householder; spiritual neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant is a name for the six equanimous feelings connected with the life of renunciation*.



.. [AFn41] (Ven. Anandajoti 41) Relying on an ambiguity in the Pāḷi (which also exists in the English), at the beginning of the *Contemplation of (the Nature of) Things* the commentary will say: *to teach ... the contemplation of mind the Auspicious One ... took up the constituent of consciousness*. Consciousness (*viññāṇa*) in the constituents, however, is confined to the six spheres of consciousness. The complexes that are defined here more properly belong to the constituent of (mental) processes.
 
.. [AFn42] (Ven. Anandajoti 42) The commentary explains that when *without passion* is said it does not indicate the supermundane state, but only that the mind is in a wordly wholesome or inconsequential state and the same interpretation is to be applied to *hate* and *delusion* below. Throughout this section the Comm is careful to note that we are not talking about supermundane states.

.. [AFn43] (Ven. Anandajoti 43) Comm: **saṅkhittaṁ** *means fallen into sloth and torpor, this is therefore a name for a shrunken mind; scattered means having become agitated, this is therefore a name for the distracted mind*. I depart from the commentary here in my translation as the whole logic of this passage is that ethical opposites are being set in contrast, and *shrunken* on the one hand, and *distracted* on the other are not opposites ethically and therefore do not fit into this pattern. *Saṅkhittaṁ* literally means *thrown (or brought) together*, and *vikkhittaṁ* means *thrown apart*.

.. [AFn44] (Ven. Anandajoti 44) Comm: **become very great** *means being conversant with the form and formless fields; not become very great means being conversant (only) with the sensual field*. Similarly for *surpassable & unsurpassable* below.

.. [AFn45] (Ven. Anandajoti 45) Comm: *concentratedmeans he who has fixed concentration or access concentration*; **not concentrated** *(indicates being) devoid of both (types of) concentration*.

.. [AFn46] (Ven. Anandajoti 46) Comm: **liberated** *means liberated by (replacing) this factor (with the opposite factor, during vipassanā meditation), and by withdrawing support (in absorption meditation);* **not liberated** *(indicates being) devoid of both (types of) liberation*. We can note here that the list of qualities in this section is ordered not according to logical opposites, but according to grammatical opposition.



.. [AFn47] (Ven. Anandajoti 47) The commentary has 2 explanations for the meaning of *dhamma* in this section, one is that *Contemplation of the Body* dealt with form, *Contemplation of Feelings* and *Mind* dealt with the formless, and *Contemplation of (the Nature of) Things* deals with a mixture of form and formless; or, secondly, a division into the constituents was intended: *body* = *form*, *feelings*, *mind* = *consciousness*, and here *dhamma* = *perception* and *(mental) processes*. Translations usually follow the second of these explanations, giving *dhamma* the meaning of mental contents or mental objects. However, as noted above, *Contemplation of Mind* really deals with mental processes, not with the sense consciousness. As noted in the Introduction, in other versions of this teaching it appears that the original structure of this section only included the hindrances and the factors of awakening, which are both lists of ethical qualities of mind. I believe *dhamma* in this original context probably meant *ethical states*, a well-attested meaning for the word, but one no longer useable once the additions of the constituents, sense-spheres and truths have been included.
 
.. [AFn48] (Ven. Anandajoti 48) Here *ajjhattaṁ* takes on another nuance. The parsing of the word is as *adhi-*, here meaning *in*, *within* + *-atta*, meaning the self, to be translated when standing alone as oneself (*himself*, *herself*, *itself*), according to context. In the next line, when in conjunction with me it becomes *myself*.

.. [AFn49] (Ven. Anandajoti 49) Many teachings these days seem to stop short at just knowing the state of the mind, but this in itself is not sufficient for the practice of mindfulness, which continues by elucidating the further skilful states of mind that need to be developed to be able to overcome the various sorts of defilements that can arise in the mind.

.. [AFn50] (Ven. Anandajoti 50) Comm: *these six things lead to the giving up of sloth and torpor: grasping that the cause is in too much food, a complete change of the postures, applying the mind to the perception of light, dwelling in open grounds, having spiritual friendship and suitable talk.*

.. [AFn51] (Ven. Anandajoti 51) Comm: *these six things lead to the giving up of agitation and worry: learning, questioning, gratitude towards the discipline, association with elders, having spiritual friendship and suitable talk*.

.. [AFn52] (Ven. Anandajoti 52) *Vicikicchā* is from the verb *vicikicchati*. The verb is made from the prefix *vi-* with the intensive verb *cikicchati* which is formed from √ *cit*, meaning, therefore, *to think and think*; the prefix vi- should be taken in the second sense given in PED: denoting *disturbance, seperation, mixing up...*: it thus means *thinking again and again in a mixed up way*.

.. [AFn53] (Ven. Anandajoti 53) *Upādāna* has two meanings, *attachment* and *fuel*, and they are probably both implied in this context, hence the translation adopted here. *Pañcakkhandha* is commonly translated as the *five aggregates*, which had me scurrying to the dictionary when I first encountered it, as I had no idea what *aggregate* could mean in such a context. What it actually means, in more lucid English, is *constituent*, which is the translation adopted here. As what they constitute may not be altogether clear there is the explanatory addition in brackets.

.. [AFn54] (Ven. Anandajoti 54) In the Dhamma the sense-spheres include the five physical senses as well as the mind. These are then further divided into the internal sense-spheres: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind; and their external equivalents: forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles and thoughts. These form the basis for sensual attachment.

.. [AFn55] (Ven. Anandajoti 55) Ten fetters are mentioned in the commentary (to MN 10): *the passion for sense-desire* (*kāmarāga*), *revulsion* (*paṭigha*), *conceit* (*māna*), *views* (*diṭṭhi*), *doubt* (*vicikicchā*), *grasping at virtue and practice* (*sīlabbataparāmāsa*), *passion for existence* (*bhavarāga*), *jealousy* (*issā*), *selfishness* (*macchariya*) and *ignorance* (*āvijjā*). This is an Abhidhammic list, which differs from the fetters normally listed in the discourses (at DN 6, etc.)

.. [AFn56] (Ven. Anandajoti 56) This is an important principle in the Dhamma: the fetter is not the eye, and similarly it is not the form (and not the ear or sound, nor any of the other pairs mentioned). The fetter arises dependent on them, but it is the mental defilement which is the fetter, and it is perfectly possible to have eyes and forms without the fetter (see SN 41.1).

.. [AFn57] (Ven. Anandajoti 57) According to the commentary here views, doubt, grasping at virtue and practice, jealousy and selfishness are thrown off at the first stage of Awakening (*sotāpatti*); gross sense-desire and revulsion by the second stage (*sakadāgāmitā*) and even subtle forms of the same by the third stage (*anāgāmitā*); and conceit, passion for existence and ignorance by the fourth and final stage (*arahatta*).

.. [AFn58] (Ven. Anandajoti 58) *Bojjhaṅga* > *Bodhy* + *aṅga*, *Bodhi* + *aṅga*. From √ *budh*, the primal meaning of which is *to awaken*. Through development *bodhi* also means *to understand*, hence the alternative translation *Enlightenment*. The commentary allows for both meanings: *the seven harmonious qualities by which he completely awakens, rises from the sleep of the corruptions, or penetrates the Truths, those harmonious qualities are (called) Complete Awakening*.

.. [AFn59] (Ven. Anandajoti 59) When we look at the structure of this section we can see that it follows the same model as the Hindrances above. These two sections appear to be the earliest and most original form of the Dhammānupassanā, to which the others were later added in the centuries following the parinibbāna.

.. [AFn60] (Ven. Anandajoti 60) Again here we can see a play on words, because *dhamma*, which is *the Teaching of Lord Buddha*, is also *the true nature of things*, and ultimately they are not different from one another, but in translation we have to choose the meaning that is most important to convey.

.. [AFn61] (Ven. Anandajoti 61) SN Bojjhaṅgasaṁyuttaṁ (46.2) asks how this factor comes to fulfilment, and answers: *there are, monks, things that are wholesome and unwholesome, blameworthy and blameless, despicable and excellent, things that resemble the dark and the bright, herein he should be one who makes much of wise reflection (on these things)*.

.. [AFn62] (Ven. Anandajoti 62) Comm: *these eleven things lead to the arising of the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening: recollection of the Buddha; recollection of the Dhamma, Saṅgha, virtue, generosity, and the gods; recollection of peace; avoidance of rough people; association with admirable people; reflection on discourses that inspire confidence; and being intent upon it* (not: *the inclination towards joy*, as translated in Way [pg. 163], which is too passive - deliberately cultivating it is what is meant). Pīti is defined as fivefold: *slight joyful-interest, momentary joyful-interest, reoccurring joyful-interest, transporting joyful-interest, suffusing joyful-interest*. The common translation of *pīti* as *rapture* would seem to apply only to the last of these.

.. [AFn63] (Ven. Anandajoti 63) *Passaddhi* is derived from the verb *passambhati*, *calms*, *quiets*, *allays*. Another word used in this discourse from the same root is *passambhayaṁ* (present participle from causative *passambheti*) in the *Ānāpānapabbaṁ* at the beginning of the Contemplation of the Body section.

.. [AFn64] (Ven. Anandajoti 64) In the Satipaṭṭhānasuttaṁ of Majjhimanikāya, this is the end of the The Section about the Four Truths, only here in the Mahā- is it elaberated on.

.. [AFn65] (Ven. Anandajoti 65) From here on the analysis of the truths corresponds closely to Ven. Sāriputta’s exposition of the same subject in The Discourse giving the Analysis of the Truths (M. 141, which has some small variations), but with the analysis of the 2nd and 3rd truths greatly expanded.

.. [AFn66] (Ven. Anandajoti 66) *Dukkha* is the same word that is used in the analysis of the feelings, meaning there: *unpleasant (feeling)*. This is unfortunate as people tend to think it has the same meaning here, which is not the case. Even pleasant feeling is impermanent and therefore *dukkha* in this sense (though it is not *dukkhavedanā*, of course). A more comprehensive translation might be *unsatisfactoriness* (and its cognates), a word too cumbersome to use without risking sounding pedantic, but good to bear in mind as a meaning for dukkha.
 
.. [AFn67] (Ven. Anandajoti 67) PTS omits these two lines, saying they might be an addition from The Discourse that Set the Dhamma Wheel Rolling (the First Discourse of the Buddha), but is then also forced to omit the later text that explains these lines. However, the explanation does not occur in the first discourse, or anywhere else in the early texts except in the Satipaṭṭhāna discourses, so that it seems that if they are genuine they must belong here.

.. [AFn68] (Ven. Anandajoti 68) To reiterate, it is not that the constituents are always suffering as in the examples given above (like birth, etc.), though they are always prone to it, rather it is that being impermanent they can never provide complete satisfaction.

.. [AFn69] (Ven. Anandajoti 69) We can see here the methodology employed with definitions in the early texts, which is to define terms by synonyms, so their actual usage in the particular context can be clearly understood.

.. [AFn70] (Ven. Anandajoti 70) Here is a good example of the methodology at work: *jarā* in its most general sense means *maturing*, which can of course have a positive sense. But in this context it doesn’t mean so much *maturing*, as *over-maturing*.

.. [AFn71] (Ven. Anandajoti 71) We can see in this definition how sometimes *dukkha* is restricted in meaning to *bodily pain*. Compare the definition of *domanassa*, *sorrow*, *mental pain* which follows where *dukkha* is also used in the definition, but with a broader connotation.

.. [AFn72] (Ven. Anandajoti 72) I translate *bhava* simply as existence in the context of the 3 planes of *bhava* (*kāmabhava*, *sensual existence*; *rūpabhava*, *form existence*; *arūpabhava*, *formless existence*). But in this context it is the *continuation* of existence that is at the heart of the matter. *Bhava* here is divided into *kammabhava, continuation of existence through (result-producing) actions*; and *uppattibhava the continuation of existence through rebirth*.

.. [AFn73] (Ven. Anandajoti 73) Comm: **Kāmataṇhā** *is craving in regard to sense pleasures, this is a name for passion regarding the five-fold sense-pleasures*. **Bhavataṇhā** *is craving in regard to the continuation of existence, because of having a wish for existence. This is a term associated with the arising of the eternalist view, passion for the form and formless existences, and a desire for absorption*. **Vibhavataṇhā** *is craving in regard to the discontinuation of existence, this is passion associated with the annihilationist view*.

.. [AFn74] (Ven. Anandajoti 74) In Saccavibhaṅgasutta (MN 141) this section, which expands on the second Noble Truth is not found. It appears to have been brought in from the the Discourse about Determining (Sammasanasutta, SN 12.66), which follows the very same scheme. The same applies to the third Noble Truth below.
 
.. [AFn75] (Ven. Anandajoti 75) This cognate use of the present participle and the present tense of the same verb, apart from its use in this and the following section, seems to be very rare in the discourses. The only other occurrence I have found is *ummajjamānā ummajjanti* (*emerging they emerge*) in the simile of the fisherman at the end of *Brahmajālasutta* (DN 1).

.. [AFn76] (Ven. Anandajoti 76) As we will see in the section on cessation, although this is the place where it arises, it isn’t the place where it necessarily arises, it can also cease in the same place, provided there is mindfulness and understanding, particularly of the danger involved in sense-desire.

.. [AFn77] (Ven. Anandajoti 77) The commentary says: *craving does not arise when these have not arisen in that place, (but) because of manifesting again and again arisen craving settles. Therefore the Auspicious One said: “In the world the eye is likeable and pleasing...” and so on.*

.. [AFn78] (Ven. Anandajoti 78) *Ariya* means primarily *belonging to the Ariyan people*; when used ethically, however, as the Buddha used it, it had the meaning of *civilised*, *worthy*, and therefore *noble*.

.. [AFn79] (Ven. Anandajoti 79) Traditionally the Path is divided into three sections: virtue (*right speech, action and livelihood*), mind-mastery (*right endeavour, mindfulness and concentration*) and wisdom (*right view and thought*), but it should be borne in mind that all factors of the Path work to support each other, and this is not a hierarchical sequence.

.. [AFn80] (Ven. Anandajoti 80) The eightfold Path, when fulfilled, becomes the tenfold Path, with the addition of *right knowledge* and *right freedom*.

.. [AFn81] (Ven. Anandajoti 81) Mundane right-view is defined elsewhere (MN 41, 117, etc.) as: *there are gifts, offerings and sacrifices, there are fruit and result for well-done and badly-done deeds, there is this world and the next world, there are (obligations towards) Mother and Father, there are spontaneously born (heavenly) beings, there are in this world monks and priests who have practiced and attained correctly, and those who, themselves having directly realised it with their deep knowledge, make known this world and the next world*; i.e. one must have understanding of wholesome and unwholesome actions, one’s duties to others, a belief in the heavenly realms and confidence in good teachers. If someone doesn’t have these, it is hard to see how he could make progress to supermundane right-view.
 
.. [AFn82] (Ven. Anandajoti 82) *Avihiṁsā* (non-violence) is simply another form of the better known *ahiṁsā*, a fundamental virtue associated with Mahātma Gandhi, which has been very influential in modern politics as a different way of getting things done: for those who are physically weak it adds the strength of morality.

.. [AFn83] (Ven. Anandajoti 83) All four are normally included in the five virtuous practices (*sīla*) under right speech (*musāvāda*), but sometimes spelt out to make another set of eight virtuous practices, which has right livelihood as the eighth (*ājīvā-aṭṭhamakasīla*).

.. [AFn84] (Ven. Anandajoti 84) These are the first three of the five precepts undertaken by lay followers. Together with the previous right speech and restraint from intoxicants they constitute the basic level of morality expected of anyone following the teaching.

.. [AFn85] (Ven. Anandajoti 85) Five types of wrong livelihood for merchants are explained in Vaṇijjāsuttaṁ (AN 5.177): *dealing in weapons (lit. swords), living beings, meat, intoxicants and poisons*; but generally speaking any activity whereby in the course of earning one’s living one has to break the precepts could be considered wrong livelihood. For monks and nuns, making a living through reading of signs, fortune telling, acting as a go-between, casting spells, accountancy, poetry, philosophy or acting as medical assistants would count as wrong livelihood (see DN 1, where they are spelt out in great detail).

.. [AFn86] (Ven. Anandajoti 86) This section on the endeavours is a good example of the Pāḷi usage of negatives, which sounds so awkward in English, where we would normally say something simple here, like: *he endeavours to prevent bad and unwholesome things from arising*. In Pāḷi, though, there is a tendency to work with negative and positive forms of the same word through the exchange of prefixes, and with cognate forms.

.. [AFn87] (Ven. Anandajoti 87) Normally *asammosa* would mean lack of confusion, absense of delusion, etc. Here the commentary defines it thus: *asammosāyā ti avināsanatthaṁ*; **for persistence** *means for non-destruction* - a meaning that is demanded by the context.

.. [AFn88] (Ven. Anandajoti 88) *Right Concentration* is always defined in terms of the absorptions in the discourses; there is no mention of such things as access concentration (*upacārasamādhi*) or momentary concentration (*khaṇikasamādhi*) until commentarial times. If they were sufficient to fulfil the Path we might have expected the Buddha to mention them.

.. [AFn89] (Ven. Anandajoti 89) *Vitakka* and *vicāra* are sometimes transalted as *applied and sustained thought*. But if this is correct then they have a meaning in this context that they have nowhere else, as elsewhere they always have the much broader meanings of *thinking and reflection*, as translated here.

.. [AFn90] (Ven. Anandajoti 90) These are the sorts of pleasurable states of mind that counteract the attachment to sense-desires, and are always recommended in the discourses, as they lead on along the Path to liberation; it is an example of what was mentioned in the Vedanānupassanā as: *spiritual pleasant feeling*.

.. [AFn91] (Ven. Anandajoti 91) Always defined in the commentaries (e.g. MNiddA, Guhaṭṭhakasuttaniddesavaṇṇanā; VinA, Verañjakaṇḍavaṇṇanā, etc.) as being the *nāmakāya*, or *mind-body*.

.. [AFn92] (Ven. Anandajoti 92) If we interpret the compound differently this might be taken to mean: *complete purity of mindfulness and equanimity*.



.. [BpitFn001] (BurmaPiṭakaA 001) Acc. to Dīgha Nikāya commentary the term "Bhikkhus" here includes all those dedicated to the practice of this Teaching and not only those who have been admitted to the Order.

.. [BpitFn002] (BurmaPiṭakaA 002) I.e., purification of the minds

.. [BpitFn003] (BurmaPiṭakaA 003) I.e., physical pain

.. [BpitFn004] (BurmaPiṭakaA 004) I.e., mental distress

.. [BpitFn005] (BurmaPiṭakaA 005) Ariya Magga

.. [BpitFn006] (BurmaPiṭakaA 006) That means "that only way"

.. [BpitFn007] (BurmaPiṭakaA 007) I.e., Satipaṭṭhāna

.. [BpitFn008] (BurmaPiṭakaA 008) I.e., what are the four Satipaṭṭhānas?

.. [BpitFn009] (BurmaPiṭakaA 009) I.e., the disciple

.. [BpitFn010] (BurmaPiṭakaA 010) Kaya — the body: strictly speaking, the aggregate of physical phenomena.

.. [BpitFn011] (BurmaPiṭakaA 011) "And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless, and repulsive nature" – same applies to sensation, mind and dhamma.

.. [BpitFn012] (BurmaPiṭakaA 012) "which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas" — same applies to sensation, mind and dhamma.

.. [BpitFn013] (BurmaPiṭakaA 013) I.e., vedana

.. [BpitFn014] (BurmaPiṭakaA 014) I.e., citta

.. [BpitFn015] (BurmaPiṭakaA 015) Dhamma: the five dhammas consisting of (1) five nīvaraṇas (2) five khandhas. (3) twelve āyatanas, (4) seven bojjhaṅgas, and (5) four ariya saccas. This will become clear in ¶¶382-403 of this sutta.



.. [BpitFn016] (BurmaPiṭakaA 016) Towards the object of concentration

.. [BpitFn017] (BurmaPiṭakaA 017) No special effort is necessary to calm down the strong inhalation and exhalation. The more one gets mental concentration the more the strong inhalation and exhalation will calm down. When the mental concentration reaches its highest point, inhalation and exhalation will become so delicate that the yogi will feel that his breathing has stopped.

.. [BpitFn018] (BurmaPiṭakaA 018) On the string turning the lathe

.. [BpitFn019] (BurmaPiṭakaA 019) I.e., it is his own breathing, and he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.

.. [BpitFn020] (BurmaPiṭakaA 020) Which is the breathing

.. [BpitFn021] (BurmaPiṭakaA 021) His own breathing

.. [BpitFn022] (BurmaPiṭakaA 022) The causes of the appearing and dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhalation and exhalation are the existence or the non-existence of the body, the nose and the mind.

.. [BpitFn023] (BurmaPiṭakaA 023) Which is inhaling and exhaling

.. [BpitFn024] (BurmaPiṭakaA 024) I.e.,vipassanā

.. [BpitFn025] (BurmaPiṭakaA 025) And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless, and repulsive nature.

.. [BpitFn026] (BurmaPiṭakaA 026) The causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment. They and their effect, i.e., the continuous appearance of physical phenomena, are called five Samudaya dhammā. The perception of these five Samudaya dhammā is called Samudaya dhammānupassi. They are perceived in the following way:

              When the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the body-postures by means of diligence, mindfulness, concentration, comprehension, he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena (nibbatti lakkhaṇā): This perception usually begins, when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassanā ñāṇa — paccaya pariggaha ñāṇa. From this perception, the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirth of beings take place in a similar way.

              Therefore, while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to:

              (1) ignorance of Four Ariya Truths;

              (2) craving for pleasure of the senses; 

              (3) kamma (deeds, words and thoughts) which has the potency for rebirth as its effect; 

              (4) nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena; 

              (5) mind (citta) which is the motivating force; 

              (6) heat and cold. The causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors. 

              The bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of Four Ariya Truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena. The actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassanā ñāṇa — Sammasana ñāṇa. The sign of change is called viparinama lakkhaṇā. In fact, the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena, by means of nibbatti and viparināma lakkhaṇā, becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassanā ñāṇa — Udayabbaya ñāṇa. However, the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger, when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa — bhaṅga ñāṇa.

.. [BpitFn027] (BurmaPiṭakaA 027) "Without soul or atta directing it" — this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height. Before he reaches this mental state, he occasionally imagines, in spite of his efforts to be mindful, (a) that body and limbs are his, (b) that his jīva (soul or atta) is directing them, to make postures. Occasionally, he even feels proud of and pleased with "his" body and limbs." \   These false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa — bhaṅga ñāṇa. From that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body. And he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such. And therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them. \   With this perception of the non-existence of the body and limbs, he fully achieves the eleventh vipassanā ñāṇa, (saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa.)

.. [BpitFn028] (BurmaPiṭakaA 028) I.e.,vipassanā

.. [BpitFn029] (BurmaPiṭakaA 029) Including the pleura, the diaphragm and other forms of membrane in the body

.. [BpitFn030] (BurmaPiṭakaA 030) The brain is not included in the Pali Text of this Sutta; but is included in the Paṭisambhidā Magga.

.. [BpitFn031] (BurmaPiṭakaA 031) I.e., lubricating oil of the joints

.. [BpitFn032] (BurmaPiṭakaA 032) The primary elements: dhātu, 'element', is a force of Nature which behaves in accordance with the laws of Nature. The four primary elements literally translated above for the sake of brevity as 'earth, water, fire, and air elements' are:

               1. Pathavī-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing hardness. (It is sometimestranslated as the element of solidity or of extension); 

               2. Āpo-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attributes of causing cohesion and of causing fluidity. (It is sometimes translated as the element of cohesion); 

               3. Tejo-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing heat or cold, i.e., thermal energy. (It is sometimes translated as the element of heat);

               4. Vāyo-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing motion or impetus. (It is sometimes translated as the element of motion).

               The Pathavī-dhātu is predominant in the first twenty items of the list given in Section (4). The Āpo-dhātu is predominant in the last twelve items. The Tejo-dhātu consists of four kinds of heat in the body and Vāyo dhātu consists of six kinds of Vāyo in the body.

.. [BpitFn033] (BurmaPiṭakaA 033) So that only pieces of meat are seen and not the cow as such

.. [BpitFn034] (BurmaPiṭakaA 034) I.e., it is his own breathing, and he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.

.. [BpitFn035] (BurmaPiṭakaA 035) Which is the breathing

.. [BpitFn036] (BurmaPiṭakaA 036) His own breathing

.. [BpitFn037] (BurmaPiṭakaA 037) The causes of the appearing and dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhalation and exhalation are the existence or the non-existence of the body, the nose and the mind.

.. [BpitFn038] (BurmaPiṭakaA 038) Which is inhaling and exhaling

.. [BpitFn039] (BurmaPiṭakaA 039) I.e.,vipassanā

.. [BpitFn040] (BurmaPiṭakaA 040) And he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.

.. [BpitFn043] (BurmaPiṭakaA 043) Fourteen Ways: consisting of one way of perception in each of the first five sections and nine ways of perception in the sixth and last Section.



.. [BpitFn044] (BurmaPiṭakaA 044) And perceive its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature

.. [BpitFn045] (BurmaPiṭakaA 045) And perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature

.. [BpitFn046] (BurmaPiṭakaA 046) The causes of the appearing of sensation are: ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma and contact (phassa). These result in the appearing of sensation. The disappearance of these causes results in the dissolution or absence of sensation.

.. [BpitFn047] (BurmaPiṭakaA 047) Without soul or atta



.. [BpitFn048] (BurmaPiṭakaA 048) I.e., citta — and perceive its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature

.. [BpitFn049] (BurmaPiṭakaA 049) I.e., is aware of

.. [BpitFn050] (BurmaPiṭakaA 050) Passion, rāga: In vipassanā bhāvanā, the bhikkhu is liable to misunderstand passion. He may think that he is required to be mindful of strong forms of passion only. He is, in fact, required to be mindful of all forms of passion — weak, medium, strong. In vipassanā, it is a very important point. Whatever takes place in the six senses, however insignificant, however good or bad it is, he is required to be mindful of it. (Passion=pleasure in or craving for something).

.. [BpitFn051] (BurmaPiṭakaA 051) Dosa: mental violence, hatred, frustration, desire to ill-treat, desire to destroy, desire to kill, are all covered by this term dosa

.. [BpitFn052] (BurmaPiṭakaA 052) Moha: (Usually defined as stupidity, dullness of mind, bewilderment, infatuation, delusion). Moha is a cetasika that makes citta (mind) incapable of choosing between right and wrong, incapable of perceiving the four Noble Truths, incapable of practicing correctly for the perception of the four Noble Truths, incapable of adopting a proper mental attitude. It is called micchāñāṇa, the intellect that is capable of giving only evil counsel in all matters. Moha makes a person blind to the nature and Consequences of a demeritorious deed.

.. [BpitFn053] (BurmaPiṭakaA 053) Saṅkhitta citta: (lit., shrunken mind); this means indolence, lethargy, slothfulness, lack of interest in anything. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn054] (BurmaPiṭakaA 054) Vikkhitta citta: A diffused or restless state of mind resulting in lack of concentration. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn055] (BurmaPiṭakaA 055) Mahaggata citta: The loftiness of mind experienced in rūpa-jhāna and arūpa-jhāna. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn056] (BurmaPiṭakaA 056) Amahaggata citta: (kāmāvacara citta): The mind as generally found in the sensuous realms, (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn057] (BurmaPiṭakaA 057) 'Sa-uttara', and 'anuttara' are relative terms, indicating inferior and superior states of mind. A state of mind that has some other state of mind superior to it, and is therefore inferior, is sa-uttara citta; a state of mind that is superior to some other state of mind is anuttara citta. Kāmāvacara citta, the state of mind of the sensuous realms, is inferior to the rūpa and arūpa jhāna states of mind. The rūpa jhāna state of mind is inferior to the arūpa jhana state of mind, but is superior to the kāmāvacara state of mind. In vipassanā practice, the arūpa jhāna state of mind is superior to both the rūpa jhāna and the kamavacara states of mind. Within the stages of the jhānas themselves, each jhāna is relatively inferior or superior, progressing to the nevasaññānāsaññāyatana jhāna which is the highest state of mind. An ordinary yogi who has no experience of jhāna cannot concentrate on the mahaggara or anuttara states of mind. 

               As a matter of fact, anuttara is normally an epithet for Lokuttarā citta or Magga-phala citta. However, in vipassanā practice, the yogi can concentrate only on the five upādānakkhandhas, the five Aggregates which form the objects of Clinging. He cannot concentrate on Magga-phala citta. Therefore, jhānas are given the epithet anuttara. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn058] (BurmaPiṭakaA 058) Samāhita citta is the mind that has samādhi, which is mental concentration on an object. According to the Commentary, Samāhita citta has (1) upacāra samādhi, and (2) appanā samādhi, (i.e., jhāna). Upacāra samādhi is samādhi that precedes, and is close to appanā samādhi, helping the latter to take place. Appanā samādhi fixes the mind on the mental object. The mind with upacāra samādhi generally belongs to the sensuous state of existence. The mind with appanā samādhi belongs to the rūpa (fine material) and arūpa (non-material) jhānas.

.. [BpitFn059] (BurmaPiṭakaA 059) Asamāhita citta: The mind without the two kinds of samādhi. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn060] (BurmaPiṭakaA 060) Vimutta citta: Here it means the mind temporarily liberated from moral defilements (kilesas). (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn061] (BurmaPiṭakaA 061) Avimutta citta: The mind not liberated from moral defilements. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn062] (BurmaPiṭakaA 062) I.e., citta — and perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature

.. [BpitFn063] (BurmaPiṭakaA 063) The causes of the appearing of the mind are: Ignorance of the four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, the complex of mental and physical aggregates (nāma-rūpa). The disappearances of these causes result in the dissolution of the mind.



.. [BpitFn064] (BurmaPiṭakaA 064) And perceive that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn065] (BurmaPiṭakaA 065) Nīvaraṇa: means obstacles in the path of one's spiritual progress. They are hindrances to doing good deeds and to the achievement of jhānas and of the four Magga Insight, There are five Hindrances:    

               (a) Kāmacchanda: all forms of taṇhā; and lobha, craving and desire.

               (b) Byāpāda: ill will; harbouring evil desires to ill-treat or destroy others, or to bring others into trouble.

               (c) Thina-middha sloth and torpor; feeling or indolence, particularly for doing good and meritorious deeds.

               (d) Uddhacca-kukkucca: distraction (or agitation) and worry. This has two aspects: flitting about of the mind (series of thought-moments) in all directions, and worrying over past commissions and omissions.

               (e) Vicikicchā: doubt or wavering of mind.

.. [BpitFn066] (BurmaPiṭakaA 066) And perceive their soulless nature

.. [BpitFn067] (BurmaPiṭakaA 067) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn068] (BurmaPiṭakaA 068) The arising of the Hindrances is due to ayoniso manasikāra, wrong perception of phenomena, resulting from taking any phenomenon as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non-repulsive. In the case of craving and desire, the Nīvaraṇa is due to taking what is actually repulsive as non-repulsive; in the case of ill will, the Nīvaraṇa is due to taking something as being offensive. The non-appearance or disappearance of the Hindrances is brought about by yoniso manasikāra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive.

               The discarded kāmacchanda will not rise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded byāpāda will not arise again due to Anāgāmi Magga. The discarded thina-middha will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded uddhacca-kukkucca will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga and Anāgāmi Magga respectively. The discarded vicikicchā will not arise again due to Sotāpatti Magga.

.. [BpitFn069] (BurmaPiṭakaA 069) Without soul or atta

.. [BpitFn070] (BurmaPiṭakaA 070) Upādānakkhandhas are the five khandha Aggregates which are the objects of Grasping or Clinging. The five khandhas are:    

               (a) rūpakkhandhā, the aggregate of physical phenomena, or the body;

               (b) vedanākkhandhā, the aggregate of sensation or feeling; 

               (c) saññākhandhā, the aggregate of perception; 

               (d) saṅkhārakkhandhā, the aggregate of volitional thought and action or mental formations, (with the exception of Vedana and sanna); and    

               (e) viññānakkhandhā, the aggregate of consciousness.

               But the magga-phala citta (lokuttara citta) is not an object of Clinging. Therefore, only the viññānakkhandhā which does not include magga-phala citta can be the object of Clinging (upādāna).

.. [BpitFn071] (BurmaPiṭakaA 071) I. e., assimilation of sensation

.. [BpitFn072] (BurmaPiṭakaA 072) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn073] (BurmaPiṭakaA 073) The causes for the appearing and dissolution of the Aggregate or physical phenomena are the same as those for body movement and posture, (see footnote to Para 375); for sensation, perception, and mental formations, the same as for sensation (see footnote to Para 380): for consciousness the same as for the Mind (see footnote to Para 381).

.. [BpitFn074] (BurmaPiṭakaA 074) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn075] (BurmaPiṭakaA 075) Fetter: saṅyojana: a fetter that binds one to endless dukkha. There are ten saṅyojanas: (i) kāmarāga, craving for sensual pleasure; (ii) paṭigha, anger, disappointment, fear, grief, ill will; (iii) māna, pride, conceit; (iv) sakkāya-diṭṭhi, belief in the illusion that there is Self, Soul; (v) vicikicchā, doubt, wavering, scepticism. (see footnote on the Hindrances in Para 382); (vi) sīlabbataparāmāsa, the misleading belief that there are paths, other than the Ariya Path of Eight Constituents, that can liberate one from dukkha; (vii) bhavarāga, craving to become a brahmā with mind and body, (rūparāga) or craving to become a brahmā with only mind and no body (arūparāga); (viii) issā, jealousy, envy; (ix) macchariya, meanness and stinginess; (x) avijjā, ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. This list is according to the Abhidhamma classification.

.. [BpitFn076] (BurmaPiṭakaA 076) A fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise due to ayoniso-manasikāra; the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded through yoniso-manasikāra; due to one of the four Ariya Maggas the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

.. [BpitFn077] (BurmaPiṭakaA 077) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn078] (BurmaPiṭakaA 078) The causes for the appearing of the physical sense-bases are ignorance of the four Noble Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment; and the dissolution of those physical sense-bases is due to the disappearance of these causes. The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind base are the same as those for the Mind; (see footnote to Para 381). The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind-object base, which are not already included in the physical sense-bases, are the same as those for Sensation; (see footnote to Para 380).

.. [BpitFn079] (BurmaPiṭakaA 079) Bojjhaṅgā, pl. of bojjhaṅga: from bodhi + aṅga. Bodhi=knowledge of the four Ariya Truths, Enlightenment, through vipassana insight, and magga-phala insight, Aṅga factor leading to such knowledge. Bojjhaṅga is generally translated as factor of enlightenment or enlightenment-factor.

.. [BpitFn080] (BurmaPiṭakaA 080) Factors which enable one to comprehend the four Ariya Truths

.. [BpitFn081] (BurmaPiṭakaA 081) Sati-sambojjhaṅga: This is a combination of three words, namely, sati=steadfast mindfulness + sam=well, positively, clearly + bojjhaṅga= one of the seven bojjhaṅga. Sati-sambojjhaṅga is the bojjhaṅga of steadfast mindfulness that enables one to comprehend clearly the four Ariya Truths.

.. [BpitFn082] (BurmaPiṭakaA 082) This is due to yoniso manasikāra: yoniso =proper + manasikāra=attention to the object. (See footnote to para 382). This also applies to the three factors of enlightenment.

.. [BpitFn083] (BurmaPiṭakaA 083) This is due to Arahatta-magga: the fourth and final stage of Magga Insight, Magga ñāṇa, in which all the kilesas, moral defilements, are eradicated. This also applies to the other factors of enlightenment.

.. [BpitFn084] (BurmaPiṭakaA 084) Dhammavicaya is a combination of two words, namely, dhamma + vicaya. Dhamma means the five khandhas, or nāmarūpa, mental and physical phenomena. Vicaya means knowledge through proper investigation. Here, investigation means vipassanā bhāvanā. So dhammavicaya means knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas by means of vipassanā bhāvanā.

.. [BpitFn085] (BurmaPiṭakaA 085) Viriya-sambojjhaṅga: Viriya means the right effort to be mindful. It is a well-balanced effort which is neither unduly strong nor unduly weak. If the effort is unduly weak, the bhikkhu cannot achieve mental concentration (samādhi). If it is unduly strong, be will become so exhausted that samādhi, which he has already achieved, can be impaired.

.. [BpitFn086] (BurmaPiṭakaA 086) Pīti: when one's viriya, effort, becomes well-balanced, after attaining sati, steadfast mindfulness, and dhamma-vicaya, knowledge of the true nature or nāmarūpa, one gets pīti, joy and satisfaction which may thrill one through and through.

.. [BpitFn087] (BurmaPiṭakaA 087) Passaddhi- sambojjhaṅga: After one has got pīti-sambojjhaṅga, one naturally gets passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga. Before this stage, one has to start the meditation process by making a definite effort to be steadfastly mindful. However, when this Passaddhi stage has been once reached, mindfulness takes place without much effort.

.. [BpitFn088] (BurmaPiṭakaA 088) Samādhi-sambojjhaṅga is a logical consequence of pīti -sambojjhaṅga and pasaddhi-sambojjhaṅga. When the bhikkhu achieves it, he is instantly and closely aware of every object as it appears in his mind.

.. [BpitFn089] (BurmaPiṭakaA 089) Upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga is a bojjhaṅga that keeps a balance between saddhā (faith) and paññā (knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas, by means or vipassanā bhāvanā. It also keeps a balance between viriya and samādhi.

.. [BpitFn090] (BurmaPiṭakaA 090) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn091] (BurmaPiṭakaA 091) The arising of the Bojjhaṅga, factors of enlightenment, is due to yoniso-manasikāra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive. The non-appearance or disappearance of a bojjhaṅga is due to ayoniso-manasikāra, wrong perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non repulsive.

.. [BpitFn092] (BurmaPiṭakaA 092) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn093] (BurmaPiṭakaA 093) Dukkha as a Noble Truth is left untranslated. "Suffering" and "ill" are inadequate renderings. Dukkha is inherent in existence. The five Aggregates which are the objects of Clinging therefore embody dukkha. Dukkha has connotations of impermanence, insubstantiality, unsatisfactoriness, emptiness, imperfection, insecurity, besides the obvious ones of suffering, physical pain (as in para 393) and mental affliction.

.. [BpitFn094] (BurmaPiṭakaA 094) I.e., repeated rebirth

.. [BpitFn095] (BurmaPiṭakaA 095) According to the Commentary.

.. [BpitFn096] (BurmaPiṭakaA 096) Of nāmarūpa

.. [BpitFn097] (BurmaPiṭakaA 097) To kilesas, moral defilements

.. [BpitFn098] (BurmaPiṭakaA 098) To kilesas, moral defilements

.. [BpitFn099] (BurmaPiṭakaA 099) Kāma-taṇhā is hankering after and becoming attached to pleasures of the senses. Bhava- taṇhā is hankering after and becoming attached to continued existence, either the current sensual existence or a better and higher existence in the rūpa (fine material) or arūpa (non-material) brahmā realms, or becoming attached to the rūpa and arūpa jhānas. Vibhava- taṇhā is hankering after and becoming attached to the idea that there is no kamma for rebirth, and hence no future existence.

.. [BpitFn100] (BurmaPiṭakaA 100) Establishes: nivisati recurs again and again. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn101] (BurmaPiṭakaA 101) Upādānakkhandhas: In the Pāḷi text, loka, which the Commentary explains as the Aggregates which are the objects of Clinging.

.. [BpitFn102] (BurmaPiṭakaA 102) I. e., in the eye

.. [BpitFn103] (BurmaPiṭakaA 103) I.e. consciousness arising in the eye

.. [BpitFn104] (BurmaPiṭakaA 104) I. e., contact with the sense of sight

.. [BpitFn105] (BurmaPiṭakaA 105) I.e. contact with the sense of hearing

.. [BpitFn106] (BurmaPiṭakaA 106) I. e. , contact with the sense of smell

.. [BpitFn107] (BurmaPiṭakaA 107) Vitakka is the initial turning of the mind towards the object of attention. It is also rendered as 'reflection', thinking' or 'thought-conception'. Vicāra is the deliberate investigation or examination by the mind of the object of attention.

.. [BpitFn108] (BurmaPiṭakaA 108) This, in fact, is realization of Nibbana

.. [BpitFn109] (BurmaPiṭakaA 109) I.e., in the eye

.. [BpitFn110] (BurmaPiṭakaA 110) I.e., Nibbana

.. [BpitFn111] (BurmaPiṭakaA 111) I.e., the Path leading to Nibbana

.. [BpitFn112] (BurmaPiṭakaA 112) I.e., thoughts of loving-kindness

.. [BpitFn113] (BurmaPiṭakaA 113) I.e., thoughts of compassion

.. [BpitFn114] (BurmaPiṭakaA 114) In samatha, vipassana meditation

.. [BpitFn115] (BurmaPiṭakaA 115) I.e., the disciple

.. [BpitFn116] (BurmaPiṭakaA 116) And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless and repulsive nature

.. [BpitFn117] (BurmaPiṭakaA 117) Which will appear if he is not mindful of the five khandhas

.. [BpitFn118] (BurmaPiṭakaA 118) And perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature

.. [AnālaFn01] (Ven. Anālayo 01) For my rendering of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, I have mostly adopted the translation given in Ñanamoli (1995): pp.145–55. In a few instances, however, I have ventured to introduce my own renderings, based on the understanding gained in the progress of my research. In order to facilitate references to particular passages of the discourse, I have inserted a short headline above each section.
