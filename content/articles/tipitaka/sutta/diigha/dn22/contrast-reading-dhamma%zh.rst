       在身內有瞋，他詳知︰『我的身內有瞋』；或在身內無瞋，他詳知︰『我的身內無瞋』；像對未被生的瞋出生了，他詳知它；及像對被生的瞋，徹底捨斷，他詳知它；及像對被徹底捨斷的瞋，在未來不出生，他詳知它。

       或在身內有昏沈及呆滯，他詳知︰『我的內心有昏沈及呆滯』；或在身內無昏沈及呆滯，他詳知︰『我的內心無昏沈及呆滯』；及像對未被生的昏沈及呆滯出生了，他詳知它；及像對已被生的昏沈及呆滯，徹底捨斷，他詳知它；及像徹底捨斷的昏沈及呆滯，在未來不出生，他詳知它。

       或在身內有掉舉與後悔，他詳知︰『我的內心有掉舉與後悔』；或像在身內無掉舉與後悔，他詳知︰『我的內心無掉舉與後悔』；及像對未被生的掉舉與後悔出生了，他詳知它；及像對被生的掉舉與後悔，徹底捨斷，他詳知它；及像徹底捨斷的掉舉與後悔，在未來不出生，他詳知它。

       在此，諸比丘，比丘依五蓋而安住於觀法為法。
       
       諸比丘，比丘如何依五蓋而安住於觀法為法呢？在此，諸比丘，內心有欲欲\ [PaauFn01]_\時，比丘了知：『我內心有欲欲。』內心沒有欲欲時，他了知：『我內心沒有欲欲。』他了知尚未生起的欲欲如何在他內心生起；他了知已經在他內心生起的欲欲如何被滅除；他了知已經被滅除的欲欲如何不會再於未來生起。
       
       內心有瞋恨時，他了知：『我內心有瞋恨。』內心沒有瞋恨時，他了知：『我內心沒有瞋恨。』他了知尚未生起的瞋恨如何在他內心生起；他了知已經在他內心生起的瞋恨如何被滅除；他了知已經被滅除的瞋恨如何不會再於未來生起。
       
       內心有昏沉與睡眠時，他了知：『我內心有昏沉與睡眠。』內心沒有昏沉與睡眠時，他了知：『我內心沒有昏沉與睡眠。』他了知尚未生起的昏沉與睡眠如何在他內心生起；他了知已經在他內心生起的昏沉與睡眠如何被滅除；他了知已經被滅除的昏沉與睡眠如何不會再於未來生起。
       
       內心有掉舉與追悔時，他了知：『我內心有掉舉與追悔。』內心沒有掉舉與追悔時，他了知：『我內心沒有掉舉與追悔。』他了知尚未生起的掉舉與追悔如何在他內心生起；他了知已經在他內心生起的掉舉與追悔如何被滅除；他了知已經被滅除的掉舉與追悔如何不會再於未來生起。
       
       內心有懷疑時，他了知：『我內心有懷疑。』內心沒有懷疑時，他了知：『我內心沒有懷疑。』他了知尚未生起的懷疑如何在他內心生起；他了知已經在他內心生起的懷疑如何被滅除；他了知已經被滅除的懷疑如何不會再於未來生起。
       
       如此，他安住於觀照內在的法為法、安住於觀照外在的法為法或安住於觀照內在與外在的法為法。他安住於觀照法的生起現象、安住於觀照法的壞滅現象或安住於觀照法的生起與壞滅現象。或者他建立起『有法』的正念只為了更高的智慧與正念。他獨立地安住，不執著世間的任何事物。諸比丘，這就是比丘依五蓋而安住於觀法為法的方法。

     - **Contemplation of (the Nature of) Things**
       
       **The Section about the Hindrances**
       
       382. And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things”?\ [AFn47]_ Here, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the five hindrances.

       And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the five hindrances?
       
       Here, monks, a monk having **sensual desire** in himself\ [AFn48]_ knows “there is sensual desire in myself”; or, not having sensual desire in himself he knows “there is no sensual desire in myself”. How there is an arising of sensual desire that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of sensual desire that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of abandoned sensual desire again in the future – that also he knows.\ [AFn49]_
       
       Having **ill-will** in himself he knows “there is ill-will in myself”; or, not having ill-will in himself he knows “there is no ill-will in myself”. How there is an arising of ill-will that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of ill-will that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of abandoned ill-will again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       Having **sloth and torpor** in himself he knows “there is sloth and torpor in myself”; or, not having sloth and torpor in himself he knows “there is no sloth and torpor in myself”. How there is an arising of sloth and torpor that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of sloth and torpor that has arisen\ [AFn50]_ – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of abandoned sloth and torpor again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       Having **agitation and worry** in himself he knows “there is agitation and worry in myself”; or, not having agitation and worry in himself he knows “there is no agitation and worry in myself”. How there is an arising of agitation and worry that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of agitation and worry that has arisen\ [AFn51]_ – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of abandoned agitation and worry again in the future – that also he knows.

       Having doubt in himself he knows “there is doubt\ [AFn52]_ in myself”; or, not having **doubt** in himself he knows “there is no doubt in myself”. How there is an arising of doubt that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of doubt that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of abandoned doubt again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       \ * * *
       
       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself and in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in things, or else mindfulness that “there are these (various) things” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness, and he dwells independent, and without being attached to anything in the world.
       
       In this way, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the five hindrances.

     - **Perception of the True Nature of Dhamma**
       
       **1. SECTION ON THE HINDRANCES**

       382. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on dhamma, mental and physical phenomena?\ [BpitFn064]_ Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching keeps his mind steadfastly on the mental phenomena of the five Hindrances.\ [BpitFn065]_ And how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the five Hindrances?\ [BpitFn066]_

       Bhikkhus, when sense-desire is present in him, the bhikkhu following my Teaching knows, 'There is sense-desire in me'; or when sense-desire is not present in him, he knows, 'There is no sense-desire in me'. Besides, he knows how the sense-desire which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the sense-desire that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded sense-desire will not arise in the future.

       When ill will is present in him, he knows 'There is ill will in me'; or when ill will is not present in him, he knows 'There is no ill will in me'. Besides, he knows that the ill will which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the ill will that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded ill-will will not arise in the future.

       When sloth and torpor are present in him, he knows 'There are sloth and torpor in me'; or when sloth and torpor are not present in him, he knows 'There are no sloth and torpor in me'. Besides, he knows that the sloth and torpor which have not yet arisen come to arise; and he knows that the sloth and torpor that have arisen come to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded sloth and torpor will not arise in the future.

       When distraction and worry are present in him, he knows 'There are distraction and worry in me'; or when distraction and worry are not present in him, he knows 'There are no distraction and worry in me'. Besides, he knows that the distraction and worry which have not yet arisen come to arise; and he knows that the distraction and worry that have arisen come to be discarded; and be knows that the discarded distraction and worry will not arise in the future.

       When doubt or wavering of the mind is present in him, he knows 'There is doubt in me'; or when doubt is not present in him, he knows 'There is no doubt in me'. Besides, he knows that the doubt which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the doubt that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded doubt will not arise in the future.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn067]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma; in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma, with their causes.\ [BpitFn068]_ And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma.\ [BpitFn069]_ That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the five nivarana dhamma perceiving its true nature.

       382. "And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in & of themselves?

       **[1]** "There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the five hindrances. And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in & of themselves with reference to the five hindrances? There is the case where, there being sensual desire present within, a monk discerns that 'There is sensual desire present within me.'

       383. And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the mental and physical phenomena of the five Aggregates\ [BpitFn070]_ which are the objects of Clinging, (and perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul). Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the five Aggregates which are the objects of clinging?

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching perceives thus: 'Such is physical phenomenon; such is the origination of physical phenomenon; such is the disappearance of physical phenomenon. Such is sensation; such is the origination of sensation; such is the disappearance of sensation. Such is perception;\ [BpitFn071]_ such is the origination of perception; such is the disappearance of perception. Such is mental formations; such is the origination of mental formations; such is the disappearance of mental formations. Such is consciousness; such is the origination of consciousness; such is the disappearance of consciousness.'

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn072]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma;. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma with their causes.\ [BpitFn073]_ And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only Dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on this five upadanakkhandhas dhamma perceiving its true nature.

       384. Moreover, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the six internal and external sense-spheres.\ [AFn54]_
       
       And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the six internal and external sense-spheres?
       
       Here, monks, a monk knows the **eye**, and he knows **forms**; and the fetter\ [AFn55]_ that arises dependent on the pair of them\ [AFn56]_ – that also he knows.
       
       How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future\ [AFn57]_ – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **ear**, and he knows **sounds**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **nose**, and he knows **smells**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **tongue**, and he knows **tastes**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **body**, and he knows **tangibles**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       He knows the **mind**, and he knows **thoughts**, and the fetter that arises dependent on the pair of them – that also he knows. How there is an arising of a fetter that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is an abandonment of a fetter that has arisen – that also he knows; and how there is a non-arising of an abandoned fetter again in the future – that also he knows.
       
       \* * *
       
       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things in regard to himself and in regard to others, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in things, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in things, or else mindfulness that “there are these (various) things” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness, and he dwells independent, and without being attached to anything in the world.
       
       In this way, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the six internal and external sense-spheres.

       384. And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the mental and physical phenomena of the six internal and the six external ayatanas, sense-bases.\ [BpitFn074]_ Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the six internal and the six external ayatana dhamma?

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following my Teaching is conscious of the eye, is also conscious of visible objects, and knows any fetter\ [BpitFn075]_ that arises dependent on both the eye and the visible object. Besides, he knows how a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the ear, is also conscious of sounds, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the ear and the sound. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the nose, is also conscious of odors, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the nose and the odor. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the tongue, is also conscious of tastes, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the tongue and the taste. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the body, is also conscious of tactual objects, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the body and the tactual object. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

       He is conscious of the mind, is also conscious of mind-objects, and knows any fetter that arises dependent on both the mind and the mind-object. Besides, he knows that a fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise; and he knows that the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded; and he knows that the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.\ [BpitFn076]_

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn077]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma;. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma with their causes.\ [BpitFn078]_ And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only Dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the six internal and six external āyatana dhammā perceiving its true nature.

       And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) things in (various) things, in the seven factors of Awakening?\ [AFn59]_

       Here, monks, a monk having the **Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening** in himself knows “there is the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Mindfulness factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.

How there is an arising of the Energy factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Energy factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.

How there is an arising of the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.
       
       Having the **Calmness**\ [AFn63]_ **factor of Complete Awakening** in himself he knows “there is the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”; or, not having the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening in himself he knows “there is no Calmness factor of Complete Awakening in myself”. How there is an arising of the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening that has not arisen – that he knows; and how there is fulfilment of the development of the Calmness factor of Complete Awakening that has arisen – that also he knows.

And again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the mental phenomena of the seven enlightenment factors,\ [BpitFn080]_ and perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul. And, bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the seven bojjhanga, and perceive their soulless nature?

       Bhikkhus, when the enlightenment-factor of Mindfulness,\ [BpitFn081]_ is present in him, the bhikkhu following my Teaching knows "sati-sambojjhaṅga is present in me"; or when sati-sambojjhanga is not present in him, he knows 'sati-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the sati-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise;\ [BpitFn082]_ and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing\ [BpitFn083]_ the arisen sati-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of investigative knowledge of phenomena,\ [BpitFn084]_ is present in him, he knows "dhammavicaya- sambojjhaṅga is present in me"; or when dhammavicaya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'dhamma Vicaya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the dhammavicaya-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen dhamma vicaya-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of effort,\ [BpitFn085]_ is present in him, he knows 'viriya-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when viriya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'viriya-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the viriya-sambojjhaṅga which has not yet arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen viriya-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of delightful satisfaction,\ [BpitFn086]_ is present in him, he knows 'pīti-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when pīti-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'pīti-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the pīti-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen pīti-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of serenity,\ [BpitFn087]_ is present in him, he knows 'passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how the complete fulfillment in developing the arisen passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment-factor of concentration,\ [BpitFn088]_ is present in him, he knows 'samādhi- sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when samādhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'samādhi-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the samādhi-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how the complete fulfillment in developing the arisen samādhi-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       When the enlightenment factor of equanimity,\ [BpitFn089]_ is present in him, he knows 'upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga is present in me'; or when upekkhā- sambojjhaṅga is not present in him, he knows 'upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga is not present in me'. Besides, he knows that the upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga which has not arisen before comes to arise; and he knows how complete fulfillment in developing the arisen upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga comes about.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the dhamma, mental and physical phenomena, in himself.\ [BpitFn090]_ Occasionally he realizes that the dhamma in others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the dhamma in himself or in others. When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the dhamma;. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma with their causes.\ [BpitFn091]_ And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only Dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is also in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the seven bojjhaṅgā perceiving its true nature.

     - **Exposition of the Noble Truth of the Origin of Dukkha**

       400. And, bhikkhus, what is the Noble Truth of the origin of dukkha? The origin of dukkha is the Craving which gives rise to fresh rebirth, and, accompanied by pleasure and passion, finds great delight in this or that existence, namely, Craving for pleasures of the senses,\ [BpitFn099]_ Craving for better existence, and Craving for non-existence.

     - **Exposition of the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha**
       
       401. And, bhikkhus, what is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha? It is the complete extinction and cessation of this very Craving, its abandoning and discarding, the liberation and detachment from it.\ [BpitFn108]_

       But, bhikkhus, when this Craving is abandoned, where is it abandoned? When it ceases, where does it cease? When this Craving is abandoned or ceases, it is abandoned, or it ceases in the delightful and pleasurable characteristics of the upadanakkhandhas.

       What are the delightful and pleasurable characteristics of the upadanakkhandhas?

       In the upadanakkhandhas, the eye has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there;\ [BpitFn109]_ when it ceases, it ceases there. In the upadanakkhandhas, the ear... In the upadanakkhandhas, the nose... In the upadanakkhandhas, the tongue... In the upadanakkhandhas, the body... In the upadanakkhandhas, the mind has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, visible objects... In the upadanakkhandhas, sounds... In the upadanakkhandhas, odors... In the upadanakkhandhas, tastes... In the upadanakkhandhas, tactual objects... In the upadanakkhandhas, mind-objects have the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, the sensation born of eye-contact, the sensation born of ear-contact, the sensation born of nose-contact, the sensation born of tongue-contact. the sensation born of body-contact, the sensation born of mind-contact, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, perception of visible objects, perception of sounds, perception of odors, perception of tastes, perception of tactual objects, perception of mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when It ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, volition focused on visible objects, volition focused on sounds, volition focused on odors, volition focused on tastes, volition focused on tactual objects, volition focused on mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, Craving for visible objects, Craving for sounds, Craving for odors, Craving for tastes, Craving for tactual objects, Craving for mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, It is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, vitakka, initial application of the mind to visible objects, to sounds to odors, to tastes, to tactual objects, to mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, It is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       In the upadanakkhandhas, vicara, sustained application of the mind to visible objects, to sounds, to odors, to tastes, to tactual objects, to mind-objects, each has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable. When this Craving is abandoned, it is abandoned there; when it ceases, it ceases there.

       "And what is right concentration?

With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought & evaluation — internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure & pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress — he enters & remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.

He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the dhamma. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the dhamma, with their causes. And further the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there are only dhamma. That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating.

.. [AFn47] (Ven. Anandajoti 47) The commentary has 2 explanations for the meaning of *dhamma* in this section, one is that *Contemplation of the Body* dealt with form, *Contemplation of Feelings* and *Mind* dealt with the formless, and *Contemplation of (the Nature of) Things* deals with a mixture of form and formless; or, secondly, a division into the constituents was intended: *body* = *form*, *feelings*, *mind* = *consciousness*, and here *dhamma* = *perception* and *(mental) processes*. Translations usually follow the second of these explanations, giving *dhamma* the meaning of mental contents or mental objects. However, as noted above, *Contemplation of Mind* really deals with mental processes, not with the sense consciousness. As noted in the Introduction, in other versions of this teaching it appears that the original structure of this section only included the hindrances and the factors of awakening, which are both lists of ethical qualities of mind. I believe *dhamma* in this original context probably meant *ethical states*, a well-attested meaning for the word, but one no longer useable once the additions of the constituents, sense-spheres and truths have been included.
 
.. [AFn48] (Ven. Anandajoti 48) Here *ajjhattaṁ* takes on another nuance. The parsing of the word is as *adhi-*, here meaning *in*, *within* + *-atta*, meaning the self, to be translated when standing alone as oneself (*himself*, *herself*, *itself*), according to context. In the next line, when in conjunction with me it becomes *myself*.

.. [AFn49] (Ven. Anandajoti 49) Many teachings these days seem to stop short at just knowing the state of the mind, but this in itself is not sufficient for the practice of mindfulness, which continues by elucidating the further skilful states of mind that need to be developed to be able to overcome the various sorts of defilements that can arise in the mind.

.. [AFn50] (Ven. Anandajoti 50) Comm: *these six things lead to the giving up of sloth and torpor: grasping that the cause is in too much food, a complete change of the postures, applying the mind to the perception of light, dwelling in open grounds, having spiritual friendship and suitable talk.*

.. [AFn51] (Ven. Anandajoti 51) Comm: *these six things lead to the giving up of agitation and worry: learning, questioning, gratitude towards the discipline, association with elders, having spiritual friendship and suitable talk*.

.. [AFn52] (Ven. Anandajoti 52) *Vicikicchā* is from the verb *vicikicchati*. The verb is made from the prefix *vi-* with the intensive verb *cikicchati* which is formed from √ *cit*, meaning, therefore, *to think and think*; the prefix vi- should be taken in the second sense given in PED: denoting *disturbance, seperation, mixing up...*: it thus means *thinking again and again in a mixed up way*.

.. [AFn53] (Ven. Anandajoti 53) *Upādāna* has two meanings, *attachment* and *fuel*, and they are probably both implied in this context, hence the translation adopted here. *Pañcakkhandha* is commonly translated as the *five aggregates*, which had me scurrying to the dictionary when I first encountered it, as I had no idea what *aggregate* could mean in such a context. What it actually means, in more lucid English, is *constituent*, which is the translation adopted here. As what they constitute may not be altogether clear there is the explanatory addition in brackets.

.. [AFn54] (Ven. Anandajoti 54) In the Dhamma the sense-spheres include the five physical senses as well as the mind. These are then further divided into the internal sense-spheres: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind; and their external equivalents: forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles and thoughts. These form the basis for sensual attachment.

.. [AFn55] (Ven. Anandajoti 55) Ten fetters are mentioned in the commentary (to MN 10): *the passion for sense-desire* (*kāmarāga*), *revulsion* (*paṭigha*), *conceit* (*māna*), *views* (*diṭṭhi*), *doubt* (*vicikicchā*), *grasping at virtue and practice* (*sīlabbataparāmāsa*), *passion for existence* (*bhavarāga*), *jealousy* (*issā*), *selfishness* (*macchariya*) and *ignorance* (*āvijjā*). This is an Abhidhammic list, which differs from the fetters normally listed in the discourses (at DN 6, etc.)

.. [AFn56] (Ven. Anandajoti 56) This is an important principle in the Dhamma: the fetter is not the eye, and similarly it is not the form (and not the ear or sound, nor any of the other pairs mentioned). The fetter arises dependent on them, but it is the mental defilement which is the fetter, and it is perfectly possible to have eyes and forms without the fetter (see SN 41.1).

.. [AFn57] (Ven. Anandajoti 57) According to the commentary here views, doubt, grasping at virtue and practice, jealousy and selfishness are thrown off at the first stage of Awakening (*sotāpatti*); gross sense-desire and revulsion by the second stage (*sakadāgāmitā*) and even subtle forms of the same by the third stage (*anāgāmitā*); and conceit, passion for existence and ignorance by the fourth and final stage (*arahatta*).

.. [AFn58] (Ven. Anandajoti 58) *Bojjhaṅga* > *Bodhy* + *aṅga*, *Bodhi* + *aṅga*. From √ *budh*, the primal meaning of which is *to awaken*. Through development *bodhi* also means *to understand*, hence the alternative translation *Enlightenment*. The commentary allows for both meanings: *the seven harmonious qualities by which he completely awakens, rises from the sleep of the corruptions, or penetrates the Truths, those harmonious qualities are (called) Complete Awakening*.

.. [AFn59] (Ven. Anandajoti 59) When we look at the structure of this section we can see that it follows the same model as the Hindrances above. These two sections appear to be the earliest and most original form of the Dhammānupassanā, to which the others were later added in the centuries following the parinibbāna.

.. [AFn60] (Ven. Anandajoti 60) Again here we can see a play on words, because *dhamma*, which is *the Teaching of Lord Buddha*, is also *the true nature of things*, and ultimately they are not different from one another, but in translation we have to choose the meaning that is most important to convey.

.. [AFn61] (Ven. Anandajoti 61) SN Bojjhaṅgasaṁyuttaṁ (46.2) asks how this factor comes to fulfilment, and answers: *there are, monks, things that are wholesome and unwholesome, blameworthy and blameless, despicable and excellent, things that resemble the dark and the bright, herein he should be one who makes much of wise reflection (on these things)*.

.. [AFn62] (Ven. Anandajoti 62) Comm: *these eleven things lead to the arising of the Joyful-Interest factor of Complete Awakening: recollection of the Buddha; recollection of the Dhamma, Saṅgha, virtue, generosity, and the gods; recollection of peace; avoidance of rough people; association with admirable people; reflection on discourses that inspire confidence; and being intent upon it* (not: *the inclination towards joy*, as translated in Way [pg. 163], which is too passive - deliberately cultivating it is what is meant). Pīti is defined as fivefold: *slight joyful-interest, momentary joyful-interest, reoccurring joyful-interest, transporting joyful-interest, suffusing joyful-interest*. The common translation of *pīti* as *rapture* would seem to apply only to the last of these.

.. [AFn63] (Ven. Anandajoti 63) *Passaddhi* is derived from the verb *passambhati*, *calms*, *quiets*, *allays*. Another word used in this discourse from the same root is *passambhayaṁ* (present participle from causative *passambheti*) in the *Ānāpānapabbaṁ* at the beginning of the Contemplation of the Body section.

.. [AFn64] (Ven. Anandajoti 64) In the Satipaṭṭhānasuttaṁ of Majjhimanikāya, this is the end of the The Section about the Four Truths, only here in the Mahā- is it elaberated on.

.. [AFn65] (Ven. Anandajoti 65) From here on the analysis of the truths corresponds closely to Ven. Sāriputta’s exposition of the same subject in The Discourse giving the Analysis of the Truths (M. 141, which has some small variations), but with the analysis of the 2nd and 3rd truths greatly expanded.

.. [AFn66] (Ven. Anandajoti 66) *Dukkha* is the same word that is used in the analysis of the feelings, meaning there: *unpleasant (feeling)*. This is unfortunate as people tend to think it has the same meaning here, which is not the case. Even pleasant feeling is impermanent and therefore *dukkha* in this sense (though it is not *dukkhavedanā*, of course). A more comprehensive translation might be *unsatisfactoriness* (and its cognates), a word too cumbersome to use without risking sounding pedantic, but good to bear in mind as a meaning for dukkha.
 
.. [AFn67] (Ven. Anandajoti 67) PTS omits these two lines, saying they might be an addition from The Discourse that Set the Dhamma Wheel Rolling (the First Discourse of the Buddha), but is then also forced to omit the later text that explains these lines. However, the explanation does not occur in the first discourse, or anywhere else in the early texts except in the Satipaṭṭhāna discourses, so that it seems that if they are genuine they must belong here.

.. [AFn68] (Ven. Anandajoti 68) To reiterate, it is not that the constituents are always suffering as in the examples given above (like birth, etc.), though they are always prone to it, rather it is that being impermanent they can never provide complete satisfaction.

.. [AFn69] (Ven. Anandajoti 69) We can see here the methodology employed with definitions in the early texts, which is to define terms by synonyms, so their actual usage in the particular context can be clearly understood.

.. [AFn70] (Ven. Anandajoti 70) Here is a good example of the methodology at work: *jarā* in its most general sense means *maturing*, which can of course have a positive sense. But in this context it doesn’t mean so much *maturing*, as *over-maturing*.

.. [AFn71] (Ven. Anandajoti 71) We can see in this definition how sometimes *dukkha* is restricted in meaning to *bodily pain*. Compare the definition of *domanassa*, *sorrow*, *mental pain* which follows where *dukkha* is also used in the definition, but with a broader connotation.

.. [AFn72] (Ven. Anandajoti 72) I translate *bhava* simply as existence in the context of the 3 planes of *bhava* (*kāmabhava*, *sensual existence*; *rūpabhava*, *form existence*; *arūpabhava*, *formless existence*). But in this context it is the *continuation* of existence that is at the heart of the matter. *Bhava* here is divided into *kammabhava, continuation of existence through (result-producing) actions*; and *uppattibhava the continuation of existence through rebirth*.

.. [AFn73] (Ven. Anandajoti 73) Comm: **Kāmataṇhā** *is craving in regard to sense pleasures, this is a name for passion regarding the five-fold sense-pleasures*. **Bhavataṇhā** *is craving in regard to the continuation of existence, because of having a wish for existence. This is a term associated with the arising of the eternalist view, passion for the form and formless existences, and a desire for absorption*. **Vibhavataṇhā** *is craving in regard to the discontinuation of existence, this is passion associated with the annihilationist view*.

.. [AFn74] (Ven. Anandajoti 74) In Saccavibhaṅgasutta (MN 141) this section, which expands on the second Noble Truth is not found. It appears to have been brought in from the the Discourse about Determining (Sammasanasutta, SN 12.66), which follows the very same scheme. The same applies to the third Noble Truth below.
 
.. [AFn75] (Ven. Anandajoti 75) This cognate use of the present participle and the present tense of the same verb, apart from its use in this and the following section, seems to be very rare in the discourses. The only other occurrence I have found is *ummajjamānā ummajjanti* (*emerging they emerge*) in the simile of the fisherman at the end of *Brahmajālasutta* (DN 1).

.. [AFn76] (Ven. Anandajoti 76) As we will see in the section on cessation, although this is the place where it arises, it isn’t the place where it necessarily arises, it can also cease in the same place, provided there is mindfulness and understanding, particularly of the danger involved in sense-desire.

.. [AFn77] (Ven. Anandajoti 77) The commentary says: *craving does not arise when these have not arisen in that place, (but) because of manifesting again and again arisen craving settles. Therefore the Auspicious One said: “In the world the eye is likeable and pleasing...” and so on.*

.. [AFn78] (Ven. Anandajoti 78) *Ariya* means primarily *belonging to the Ariyan people*; when used ethically, however, as the Buddha used it, it had the meaning of *civilised*, *worthy*, and therefore *noble*.

.. [AFn79] (Ven. Anandajoti 79) Traditionally the Path is divided into three sections: virtue (*right speech, action and livelihood*), mind-mastery (*right endeavour, mindfulness and concentration*) and wisdom (*right view and thought*), but it should be borne in mind that all factors of the Path work to support each other, and this is not a hierarchical sequence.

.. [AFn80] (Ven. Anandajoti 80) The eightfold Path, when fulfilled, becomes the tenfold Path, with the addition of *right knowledge* and *right freedom*.

.. [AFn81] (Ven. Anandajoti 81) Mundane right-view is defined elsewhere (MN 41, 117, etc.) as: *there are gifts, offerings and sacrifices, there are fruit and result for well-done and badly-done deeds, there is this world and the next world, there are (obligations towards) Mother and Father, there are spontaneously born (heavenly) beings, there are in this world monks and priests who have practiced and attained correctly, and those who, themselves having directly realised it with their deep knowledge, make known this world and the next world*; i.e. one must have understanding of wholesome and unwholesome actions, one’s duties to others, a belief in the heavenly realms and confidence in good teachers. If someone doesn’t have these, it is hard to see how he could make progress to supermundane right-view.
 
.. [AFn82] (Ven. Anandajoti 82) *Avihiṁsā* (non-violence) is simply another form of the better known *ahiṁsā*, a fundamental virtue associated with Mahātma Gandhi, which has been very influential in modern politics as a different way of getting things done: for those who are physically weak it adds the strength of morality.

.. [AFn83] (Ven. Anandajoti 83) All four are normally included in the five virtuous practices (*sīla*) under right speech (*musāvāda*), but sometimes spelt out to make another set of eight virtuous practices, which has right livelihood as the eighth (*ājīvā-aṭṭhamakasīla*).

.. [AFn84] (Ven. Anandajoti 84) These are the first three of the five precepts undertaken by lay followers. Together with the previous right speech and restraint from intoxicants they constitute the basic level of morality expected of anyone following the teaching.

.. [AFn85] (Ven. Anandajoti 85) Five types of wrong livelihood for merchants are explained in Vaṇijjāsuttaṁ (AN 5.177): *dealing in weapons (lit. swords), living beings, meat, intoxicants and poisons*; but generally speaking any activity whereby in the course of earning one’s living one has to break the precepts could be considered wrong livelihood. For monks and nuns, making a living through reading of signs, fortune telling, acting as a go-between, casting spells, accountancy, poetry, philosophy or acting as medical assistants would count as wrong livelihood (see DN 1, where they are spelt out in great detail).

.. [AFn86] (Ven. Anandajoti 86) This section on the endeavours is a good example of the Pāḷi usage of negatives, which sounds so awkward in English, where we would normally say something simple here, like: *he endeavours to prevent bad and unwholesome things from arising*. In Pāḷi, though, there is a tendency to work with negative and positive forms of the same word through the exchange of prefixes, and with cognate forms.

.. [AFn87] (Ven. Anandajoti 87) Normally *asammosa* would mean lack of confusion, absense of delusion, etc. Here the commentary defines it thus: *asammosāyā ti avināsanatthaṁ*; **for persistence** *means for non-destruction* - a meaning that is demanded by the context.

.. [AFn88] (Ven. Anandajoti 88) *Right Concentration* is always defined in terms of the absorptions in the discourses; there is no mention of such things as access concentration (*upacārasamādhi*) or momentary concentration (*khaṇikasamādhi*) until commentarial times. If they were sufficient to fulfil the Path we might have expected the Buddha to mention them.

.. [AFn89] (Ven. Anandajoti 89) *Vitakka* and *vicāra* are sometimes transalted as *applied and sustained thought*. But if this is correct then they have a meaning in this context that they have nowhere else, as elsewhere they always have the much broader meanings of *thinking and reflection*, as translated here.

.. [AFn90] (Ven. Anandajoti 90) These are the sorts of pleasurable states of mind that counteract the attachment to sense-desires, and are always recommended in the discourses, as they lead on along the Path to liberation; it is an example of what was mentioned in the Vedanānupassanā as: *spiritual pleasant feeling*.

.. [AFn91] (Ven. Anandajoti 91) Always defined in the commentaries (e.g. MNiddA, Guhaṭṭhakasuttaniddesavaṇṇanā; VinA, Verañjakaṇḍavaṇṇanā, etc.) as being the *nāmakāya*, or *mind-body*.

.. [AFn92] (Ven. Anandajoti 92) If we interpret the compound differently this might be taken to mean: *complete purity of mindfulness and equanimity*.

.. [BpitFn064] (BurmaPiṭakaA 064) And perceive that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn065] (BurmaPiṭakaA 065) Nīvaraṇa: means obstacles in the path of one's spiritual progress. They are hindrances to doing good deeds and to the achievement of jhānas and of the four Magga Insight, There are five Hindrances:    

               (a) Kāmacchanda: all forms of taṇhā; and lobha, craving and desire.

               (b) Byāpāda: ill will; harbouring evil desires to ill-treat or destroy others, or to bring others into trouble.

               (c) Thina-middha sloth and torpor; feeling or indolence, particularly for doing good and meritorious deeds.

               (d) Uddhacca-kukkucca: distraction (or agitation) and worry. This has two aspects: flitting about of the mind (series of thought-moments) in all directions, and worrying over past commissions and omissions.

               (e) Vicikicchā: doubt or wavering of mind.

.. [BpitFn066] (BurmaPiṭakaA 066) And perceive their soulless nature

.. [BpitFn067] (BurmaPiṭakaA 067) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn068] (BurmaPiṭakaA 068) The arising of the Hindrances is due to ayoniso manasikāra, wrong perception of phenomena, resulting from taking any phenomenon as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non-repulsive. In the case of craving and desire, the Nīvaraṇa is due to taking what is actually repulsive as non-repulsive; in the case of ill will, the Nīvaraṇa is due to taking something as being offensive. The non-appearance or disappearance of the Hindrances is brought about by yoniso manasikāra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive.

               The discarded kāmacchanda will not rise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded byāpāda will not arise again due to Anāgāmi Magga. The discarded thina-middha will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga. The discarded uddhacca-kukkucca will not arise again due to Arahatta Magga and Anāgāmi Magga respectively. The discarded vicikicchā will not arise again due to Sotāpatti Magga.

.. [BpitFn069] (BurmaPiṭakaA 069) Without soul or atta

.. [BpitFn070] (BurmaPiṭakaA 070) Upādānakkhandhas are the five khandha Aggregates which are the objects of Grasping or Clinging. The five khandhas are:    

               (a) rūpakkhandhā, the aggregate of physical phenomena, or the body;

               (b) vedanākkhandhā, the aggregate of sensation or feeling; 

               (c) saññākhandhā, the aggregate of perception; 

               (d) saṅkhārakkhandhā, the aggregate of volitional thought and action or mental formations, (with the exception of Vedana and sanna); and    

               (e) viññānakkhandhā, the aggregate of consciousness.

               But the magga-phala citta (lokuttara citta) is not an object of Clinging. Therefore, only the viññānakkhandhā which does not include magga-phala citta can be the object of Clinging (upādāna).

.. [BpitFn071] (BurmaPiṭakaA 071) I. e., assimilation of sensation

.. [BpitFn072] (BurmaPiṭakaA 072) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn073] (BurmaPiṭakaA 073) The causes for the appearing and dissolution of the Aggregate or physical phenomena are the same as those for body movement and posture, (see footnote to Para 375); for sensation, perception, and mental formations, the same as for sensation (see footnote to Para 380): for consciousness the same as for the Mind (see footnote to Para 381).

.. [BpitFn074] (BurmaPiṭakaA 074) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn075] (BurmaPiṭakaA 075) Fetter: saṅyojana: a fetter that binds one to endless dukkha. There are ten saṅyojanas: (i) kāmarāga, craving for sensual pleasure; (ii) paṭigha, anger, disappointment, fear, grief, ill will; (iii) māna, pride, conceit; (iv) sakkāya-diṭṭhi, belief in the illusion that there is Self, Soul; (v) vicikicchā, doubt, wavering, scepticism. (see footnote on the Hindrances in Para 382); (vi) sīlabbataparāmāsa, the misleading belief that there are paths, other than the Ariya Path of Eight Constituents, that can liberate one from dukkha; (vii) bhavarāga, craving to become a brahmā with mind and body, (rūparāga) or craving to become a brahmā with only mind and no body (arūparāga); (viii) issā, jealousy, envy; (ix) macchariya, meanness and stinginess; (x) avijjā, ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. This list is according to the Abhidhamma classification.

.. [BpitFn076] (BurmaPiṭakaA 076) A fetter which has not yet arisen comes to arise due to ayoniso-manasikāra; the fetter that has arisen comes to be discarded through yoniso-manasikāra; due to one of the four Ariya Maggas the discarded fetter will not arise in the future.

.. [BpitFn077] (BurmaPiṭakaA 077) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn078] (BurmaPiṭakaA 078) The causes for the appearing of the physical sense-bases are ignorance of the four Noble Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment; and the dissolution of those physical sense-bases is due to the disappearance of these causes. The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind base are the same as those for the Mind; (see footnote to Para 381). The causes for the appearing and the dissolution of the mind-object base, which are not already included in the physical sense-bases, are the same as those for Sensation; (see footnote to Para 380).

.. [BpitFn079] (BurmaPiṭakaA 079) Bojjhaṅgā, pl. of bojjhaṅga: from bodhi + aṅga. Bodhi=knowledge of the four Ariya Truths, Enlightenment, through vipassana insight, and magga-phala insight, Aṅga factor leading to such knowledge. Bojjhaṅga is generally translated as factor of enlightenment or enlightenment-factor.

.. [BpitFn080] (BurmaPiṭakaA 080) Factors which enable one to comprehend the four Ariya Truths

.. [BpitFn081] (BurmaPiṭakaA 081) Sati-sambojjhaṅga: This is a combination of three words, namely, sati=steadfast mindfulness + sam=well, positively, clearly + bojjhaṅga= one of the seven bojjhaṅga. Sati-sambojjhaṅga is the bojjhaṅga of steadfast mindfulness that enables one to comprehend clearly the four Ariya Truths.

.. [BpitFn082] (BurmaPiṭakaA 082) This is due to yoniso manasikāra: yoniso =proper + manasikāra=attention to the object. (See footnote to para 382). This also applies to the three factors of enlightenment.

.. [BpitFn083] (BurmaPiṭakaA 083) This is due to Arahatta-magga: the fourth and final stage of Magga Insight, Magga ñāṇa, in which all the kilesas, moral defilements, are eradicated. This also applies to the other factors of enlightenment.

.. [BpitFn084] (BurmaPiṭakaA 084) Dhammavicaya is a combination of two words, namely, dhamma + vicaya. Dhamma means the five khandhas, or nāmarūpa, mental and physical phenomena. Vicaya means knowledge through proper investigation. Here, investigation means vipassanā bhāvanā. So dhammavicaya means knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas by means of vipassanā bhāvanā.

.. [BpitFn085] (BurmaPiṭakaA 085) Viriya-sambojjhaṅga: Viriya means the right effort to be mindful. It is a well-balanced effort which is neither unduly strong nor unduly weak. If the effort is unduly weak, the bhikkhu cannot achieve mental concentration (samādhi). If it is unduly strong, be will become so exhausted that samādhi, which he has already achieved, can be impaired.

.. [BpitFn086] (BurmaPiṭakaA 086) Pīti: when one's viriya, effort, becomes well-balanced, after attaining sati, steadfast mindfulness, and dhamma-vicaya, knowledge of the true nature or nāmarūpa, one gets pīti, joy and satisfaction which may thrill one through and through.

.. [BpitFn087] (BurmaPiṭakaA 087) Passaddhi- sambojjhaṅga: After one has got pīti-sambojjhaṅga, one naturally gets passaddhi-sambojjhaṅga. Before this stage, one has to start the meditation process by making a definite effort to be steadfastly mindful. However, when this Passaddhi stage has been once reached, mindfulness takes place without much effort.

.. [BpitFn088] (BurmaPiṭakaA 088) Samādhi-sambojjhaṅga is a logical consequence of pīti -sambojjhaṅga and pasaddhi-sambojjhaṅga. When the bhikkhu achieves it, he is instantly and closely aware of every object as it appears in his mind.

.. [BpitFn089] (BurmaPiṭakaA 089) Upekkhā-sambojjhaṅga is a bojjhaṅga that keeps a balance between saddhā (faith) and paññā (knowledge of the true nature of the five khandhas, by means or vipassanā bhāvanā. It also keeps a balance between viriya and samādhi.

.. [BpitFn090] (BurmaPiṭakaA 090) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn091] (BurmaPiṭakaA 091) The arising of the Bojjhaṅga, factors of enlightenment, is due to yoniso-manasikāra, right perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as impermanent, unpleasurable, soulless and repulsive. The non-appearance or disappearance of a bojjhaṅga is due to ayoniso-manasikāra, wrong perception of phenomena, viewing all phenomena as permanent, pleasurable, endowed with soul, and non repulsive.

.. [BpitFn092] (BurmaPiṭakaA 092) And perceives that they are just phenomena without any entity or soul

.. [BpitFn093] (BurmaPiṭakaA 093) Dukkha as a Noble Truth is left untranslated. "Suffering" and "ill" are inadequate renderings. Dukkha is inherent in existence. The five Aggregates which are the objects of Clinging therefore embody dukkha. Dukkha has connotations of impermanence, insubstantiality, unsatisfactoriness, emptiness, imperfection, insecurity, besides the obvious ones of suffering, physical pain (as in para 393) and mental affliction.

.. [BpitFn094] (BurmaPiṭakaA 094) I.e., repeated rebirth

.. [BpitFn095] (BurmaPiṭakaA 095) According to the Commentary.

.. [BpitFn096] (BurmaPiṭakaA 096) Of nāmarūpa

.. [BpitFn097] (BurmaPiṭakaA 097) To kilesas, moral defilements

.. [BpitFn098] (BurmaPiṭakaA 098) To kilesas, moral defilements

.. [BpitFn099] (BurmaPiṭakaA 099) Kāma-taṇhā is hankering after and becoming attached to pleasures of the senses. Bhava- taṇhā is hankering after and becoming attached to continued existence, either the current sensual existence or a better and higher existence in the rūpa (fine material) or arūpa (non-material) brahmā realms, or becoming attached to the rūpa and arūpa jhānas. Vibhava- taṇhā is hankering after and becoming attached to the idea that there is no kamma for rebirth, and hence no future existence.

.. [BpitFn100] (BurmaPiṭakaA 100) Establishes: nivisati recurs again and again. (The Commentary)

.. [BpitFn101] (BurmaPiṭakaA 101) Upādānakkhandhas: In the Pāḷi text, loka, which the Commentary explains as the Aggregates which are the objects of Clinging.

.. [BpitFn102] (BurmaPiṭakaA 102) I. e., in the eye

.. [BpitFn103] (BurmaPiṭakaA 103) I.e. consciousness arising in the eye

.. [BpitFn104] (BurmaPiṭakaA 104) I. e., contact with the sense of sight

.. [BpitFn105] (BurmaPiṭakaA 105) I.e. contact with the sense of hearing

.. [BpitFn106] (BurmaPiṭakaA 106) I. e. , contact with the sense of smell

.. [BpitFn107] (BurmaPiṭakaA 107) Vitakka is the initial turning of the mind towards the object of attention. It is also rendered as 'reflection', thinking' or 'thought-conception'. Vicāra is the deliberate investigation or examination by the mind of the object of attention.

.. [BpitFn108] (BurmaPiṭakaA 108) This, in fact, is realization of Nibbana

.. [BpitFn109] (BurmaPiṭakaA 109) I.e., in the eye

.. [BpitFn110] (BurmaPiṭakaA 110) I.e., Nibbana

.. [BpitFn111] (BurmaPiṭakaA 111) I.e., the Path leading to Nibbana

.. [BpitFn112] (BurmaPiṭakaA 112) I.e., thoughts of loving-kindness

.. [BpitFn113] (BurmaPiṭakaA 113) I.e., thoughts of compassion

.. [BpitFn114] (BurmaPiṭakaA 114) In samatha, vipassana meditation

.. [BpitFn115] (BurmaPiṭakaA 115) I.e., the disciple

.. [BpitFn116] (BurmaPiṭakaA 116) And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless and repulsive nature
