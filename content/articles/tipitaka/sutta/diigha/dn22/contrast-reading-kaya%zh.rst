       “比丘們，一位比丘到森林、樹下或靜室盤腿坐下來，豎直腰身，把念保持安放在要繫念的地方。他只是念及呼氣和吸氣。當呼氣長的時候，知道自己呼氣長；當吸氣長的時候，知道自己吸氣長。當呼氣短的時候，知道自己呼氣短；當吸氣短的時候，知道自己吸氣短。他這樣修學： ‘我要在呼氣的時候，體會整個身體；我要在吸氣的時候，體會整個身體。我要在呼氣的時候，平息身行；我要在吸氣的時候，平息身行。’

       “比丘們，就正如一位熟練的轉盤製陶技師或他的徒弟，當拉了一個長轉的時候，知道自己拉了一個長轉；當拉了一個短轉的時候，知道自己拉了一個短轉。同樣地，一位比丘當呼氣長的時候，知道自己呼氣長；當吸氣長的時候，知道自己吸氣長。當呼氣短的時候，知道自己呼氣短；當吸氣短的時候，知道自己吸氣短。他這樣修學： ‘我要在呼氣的時候，體會整個身體；我要在吸氣的時候，體會整個身體。我要在呼氣的時候，平息身行；我要在吸氣的時候，平息身行。’

       比丘去曠野\ [MettFn04]_\，或去樹下，或去空屋坐，結跏趺後，端正身體後，使(正)念於鼻端\ [MettFn05]_\現起之後，他具念的\ [MettFn06]_\吸氣，他具念的呼氣。正在吸氣長，他詳知︰『我吸氣長』，或正在呼氣長，他詳知︰『我呼氣長』；或正在吸氣短，他詳知︰『我吸氣短』，或正在呼氣短者，他詳知︰『我呼氣短。』他學︰『感受全(吸)息\ [MettFn07]_\，我將吸氣』，他學︰『感受全(呼)息，我將呼氣』；他學︰『正使身行\ [MettFn08]_\輕安，我將吸氣』，他學︰『正使身行輕安，我將呼氣。』

       諸比丘！譬如熟練的轉轆轤者，或轉轆轤者的徒弟，正在長轉，他詳知︰『我長轉』；或正在短轉，他詳知︰『我短轉』； 同樣地，諸比丘！比丘正在呼氣長，他詳知︰『我呼氣長』，或正在呼氣長，他詳知︰『我呼氣長』；或正在吸氣短，他詳知︰『我吸氣短』；或正在呼氣短，他詳知︰『我呼氣短。』他學︰『感受全(吸)息，我將吸氣』，他學︰『感受全(呼)息，我將呼氣』；他學︰『正使身行輕安，我將吸氣』，他學︰『正使身行輕安，我將呼氣。』這樣在身內，在身隨觀身而住；或在身外，在身隨觀身而住； 或在身內及身外，在身隨觀身而住。在身隨觀集法而住；或在身隨觀滅法而住；或在身隨觀集法及(隨觀)滅法而住，或『身存在』的念現起，這樣直到浸入智、浸入憶念為止，他無依止而住，並且在世間一無所取。諸比丘！就這樣比丘在身隨觀身而住。

       **甲、安般念（呼吸念；入出息念）**

       374. 諸比丘，比丘如何安住於觀身為身呢？

       在此，諸比丘，比丘前往森林、樹下或空地，盤腿而坐，保持身體正直，安立正念在自己面前（的呼吸）。他正念地吸氣，正念地呼氣。吸氣長的時候，他了知：『我吸氣長。』呼氣長的時候，他了知：『我呼氣長。』吸氣短的時候，他了知：『我吸氣短。』呼氣短的時候，他了知：『我呼氣短。』他如此訓練：『我應當覺知（氣息的）全身而吸氣。』他如此訓練：『我應當覺知（氣息的）全身而呼氣。』他如此訓練：『我應當平靜（氣息的）身行而吸氣。』他如此訓練：『我應當平靜（氣息的）身行而呼氣。』

       就像善巧的車床師或他的學徒，當他做長彎的時候，他了知：『我做長彎。』當他做短彎的時候，他了知：『我做短彎。』同樣地，當比丘吸氣長的時候，他了知：『我吸氣長。』呼氣長的時候，他了知：『我呼氣長。』吸氣短的時候，他了知：『我吸氣短。』呼氣短的時候，他了知：『我呼氣短。』他如此訓練：『我應當覺知（氣息的）全身而吸氣。』他如此訓練：『我應當覺知（氣息的）全身而呼氣。』他如此訓練：『我應當平靜（氣息的）身行而吸氣。』他如此訓練：『我應當平靜（氣息的）身行而呼氣。』
       
       如此，他安住於觀照內在的身為身、安住於觀照外在的身為身或安住於觀照內在與外在的身為身。他安住於觀照身的生起現象、安住於觀照身的壞滅現象或安住於觀照身的生起與壞滅現象。或者他建立起『有身』的正念只為了更高的智慧與正念。他獨立地安住，不執著世間的任何事物。諸比丘，這就是比丘安住於觀身為身的方法。

     - **Contemplation of the Body**

       **The Section about In-breathing and Out-breathing**
       
       374. And how, monks, does a monk dwell contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body?
       
       Here, monks, a monk who has gone to the wilderness, or has gone to the root of a tree, or has gone to an empty place, sits down. After folding his legs crosswise, setting his body straight,\ [AFn12]_ and establishing mindfulness at the front,\ [AFn13]_ being very mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.
       
       | While breathing in long, he knows “I am breathing in long”,
       | or, while breathing out long, he knows “I am breathing out long”;
       | or, while breathing in short, he knows “I am breathing in short”,
       | or, while breathing out short, he knows “I am breathing out short”.
       | 
       | Experiencing the whole body\ [AFn14]_ I will breathe in,\ [AFn15]_ like this he trains,
       | experiencing the whole body I will breathe out, like this he trains;
       | calming the bodily process I will breathe in, like this he trains,
       | calming the bodily process I will breathe out, like this he trains.

       Just as, monks, a clever turner or turner’s apprentice while making a long turn knows “I am making a long turn”, or, while making a short turn knows “I am making a short turn”,\ [AFn16]_

       | just so, monks, a monk while breathing in long, knows “I am breathing in long”,
       | or, while breathing out long, he knows “I am breathing out long”;
       | or, while breathing in short, he knows “I am breathing in short”,
       | or, while breathing out short, he knows “I am breathing out short”.
       | 
       | Experiencing the whole body I will breathe in, like this he trains,
       | experiencing the whole body I will breathe out, like this he trains;
       | calming the bodily process I will breathe in, like this he trains,
       | calming the bodily process I will breathe out, like this he trains.
       | 

       Thus he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to himself,\ [AFn17]_ or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to others,\ [AFn18]_ or he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body in regard to himself and in regard to others,\ [AFn19]_ or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination in the body, or he dwells contemplating the nature of dissolution in the body, or he dwells contemplating the nature of origination and dissolution in the body, or else mindfulness that “there is a body” is established in him just as far as (is necessary for) a full measure of knowledge and a full measure of mindfulness,\ [AFn20]_ and he dwells independent,\ [AFn21]_ and without being attached to anything in the world.\ [AFn22]_
       
       In this way, monks, a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body.

     - **Perception of the True Nature of the Body**
       
       **1. SECTION ON BREATHING**
       
       374. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu keep his mind steadfastly on the body?

       Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu following the practice of my Teaching, having gone to the forest, or to the foot of a tree or to an empty, solitary place, sits down cross-legged, keeping his body erect, and sets up mindfulness, orienting it.\ [BpitFn016]_

       Then with entire mindfulness he breathes in and with entire mindfulness he breathes out.

       Breathing in a long inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation.

       Breathing in a short inhalation, he is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation, he is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation.

       He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. [By being fully conscious of the inhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. [By being fully conscious of the exhalation] he trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out.\ [BpitFn017]_

       Just as, bhikkhus, a skilful turner or a turner's apprentice knows a long pull\ [BpitFn018]_ when a long pull is made, or knows a short pull when a short pull is made, even so, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu breathing in a long inhalation is conscious of breathing in a long inhalation, or breathing out a long exhalation is conscious of breathing out a long exhalation, or breathing in a short inhalation is conscious of breathing in a short inhalation, or breathing out a short exhalation is conscious of breathing out a short exhalation. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the in-coming breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to be clearly conscious of the whole stretch of the out-going breath at its beginning, its middle, and at its end. He trains himself to calm down the strong inhalation as he breathes in. He trains himself to calm down the strong exhalation as he breathes out.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his.\ [BpitFn019]_

       Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena\ [BpitFn020]_ of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena of others. In this way, he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his\ [BpitFn021]_ or which is that of others.

       When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena with their causes.\ [BpitFn022]_

       And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.\ [BpitFn023]_ That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights\ [BpitFn024]_ progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.

     - **A. Body**
       
       374. "And how does a monk remain focused on the body in & of itself?

       **[1]** "There is the case where a monk — having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building — sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore\ [lit: the front of the chest]. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.

       "Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns, 'I am making a long turn,' or when making a short turn discerns, 'I am making a short turn'; in the same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long' ... He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.'

       "In this way he remains focused internally on the body in & of itself, or externally on the body in & of itself, or both internally & externally on the body in & of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination & passing away with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained to the extent of knowledge & remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in & of itself.

       374. “And how, monks, does he in regard to the body abide contemplating the body? Here, gone to the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.
       
       “Breathing in long, he knows ‘I breathe in long,’ breathing out long, he knows ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he knows ‘I breathe in short,’ breathing out short, he knows ‘I breathe out short.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body,’ he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in calming the bodily formation,’ he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out calming the bodily formation.’
       
       “Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, knows ‘I make a long turn,’ or when making a short turn knows ‘I make a short turn’ so too, breathing in long, he knows ‘I breathe in long,’… (continue as above).

       [REFRAIN]

       “In this way, in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body internally, or he abides contemplating the body externally, or he abides contemplating the body both internally and externally. Or, he abides contemplating the nature of arising in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body, or he abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body. Or, mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world.
       
       “That is how in regard to the body he abides contemplating the body.

       Thus he keeps his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his body.\ [BpitFn025]_ Occasionally he realizes that the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others must be of a similar nature. Because of this realization, he can be said to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body of others. In this way he is considered to keep his mind steadfastly on the aggregate of physical phenomena which is his own body or which is that of others.

       When he gains more concentration, he perceives the cause and the actual appearing of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body. He also perceives the cause and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body. He also perceives both the actual appearing and the actual dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is the body, with their causes.\ [BpitFn026]_

       And further, the bhikkhu is firmly mindful of the fact that there is only the aggregate of physical phenomena.\ [BpitFn027]_

       That mindfulness is solely for gaining insights\ [BpitFn028]_ progressively, solely for gaining further mindfulness stage by stage. The bhikkhu remains detached from craving and wrong views, without clinging to any of the five khandhas that are continuously deteriorating. Bhikkhus, it is in this way that the bhikkhu keeps his mind steadfastly on the body perceiving its true nature.

.. [AFn12] (Ven. Anandajoti 12) The absolutives here and in the next line are connected with the finite verbs *assasati* and *passasati* (as in Ñāṇamoli’s translation of MN 10), and not with *nisīdati* in the preceding line, in which case the folding of the legs, setting the body straight, and establishment of mindfulness would all occur before he sat down!

.. [AFn13] (Ven. Anandajoti 13) *Parimukhaṁ* means *at the front*, or perhaps, *around the mouth*, i.e. it is a vague area, not meant to be confined to one particular spot or place, which would have been easy to designate if that is what was meant (like specifying *oṭṭha*, the lip). It is of course the mindfulness that is important in the practice, not the breathing as such, which only provides a basis for the mindfulness.

.. [AFn14] (Ven. Anandajoti 14) Paṭisambhidāmagga says: *body means the two bodies - the mind-body and the physical body*; this would seem to mitigate against breathing meditation being taken solely as a body-based meditation.

.. [AFn15] (Ven. Anandajoti 15) The instruction here changes from the present tense for *breathing* to the future tense. The reason for this change is that once the mind is settled on the breath he needs to deliberately cultivate mindfulness to progress further in the practice.

.. [AFn16] (Ven. Anandajoti 16) The choice of simile here is surely significant, as the turner knows not just *what* is happening, but *how he is making it happen*, so that knowledge of the intention is also included in the practice.

.. [AFn17] (Ven. Anandajoti 17) The context seems to indicate that *contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body* means contemplating the transient, ownerless nature of the body, as is signified by the references to origination and dissolution (*samudaya & vaya [= anicca]*) on the one hand; and the impersonal knowledge “there is a body” (atthi kāyo [= anattā]) on the other. *Suffering*, the other of the three characteristics of existence (*tilakkhaṇa*) is implied in *impermanence*. And similarly in regard to the other contemplations.

.. [AFn18] (Ven. Anandajoti 18) That we are really talking about others’ bodies, and not the internal and external parts of our own body, is confirmed by the Abhidhamma Satipaṭṭhānavibhaṅga (translated elsewhere on this website), where the grammar excludes any other interpretation.

.. [AFn19] (Ven. Anandajoti 19) See DP, *ajjhattaṁ* (and °*bahiddhā*) for these meanings. In Janavasabhasutta (DN 18,26) it says: *here ... a monk dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body, ardent, with full awareness, mindfully aware, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; while he dwells contemplating (the nature of) the body in the body there he becomes perfectly concentrated, perfectly clear, and, being perfectly concentrated, perfectly clear, he generates knowledge and insight regarding the external bodies of others*. Similarly in regard to the contemplation of *feelings*, *mind*, and *the nature of things*.

.. [AFn20] (Ven. Anandajoti 20) The translation follows the commentary, which says: *just as far as, this designates, and is limited to, purpose. This is what is said: whatever mindfulness is established is not for another reason. Then the meaning of as far as (is necessary for) a measure of knowledge is so as to increase more and more, further and further, knowledge and mindfulness, for the increase of mindfulness and full awareness*. For the same word in Sanskrit having this meaning see SED under *mātra*. This seems to me to make much better sense than the usual translation of *for just knowledge and remembrance* (Way); or *for mere understanding and mere awareness* (VRI). See also MN 22, near the end, where *saddhamatta* is translated by Ñāṇamoḷi and Bodhi (MLDB) as *sufficient faith*, and *pemamatta* as *sufficient love*.

.. [AFn21] (Ven. Anandajoti 21) Comm: *he lives independent because he is not dependent on wrong views or craving*.

.. [AFn22] (Ven. Anandajoti 22) Comm: *he doesn’t grasp (anything) thinking: this is my self or this belongs to my self*.

.. [AFn23] (Ven. Anandajoti 23) This is where the idea that *sati* is *mere awareness* breaks down irretrievably, because as the commentary says: *even animals like dogs and jackals know they are going when they are going ... but they do not uproot the perception of a self and cannot be said to be attending to mindfulness or a (proper) meditation subject*. We see that mindfulness as taught here is always mindfulness of the true nature of reality, which is the liberating factor.

.. [AFn24] (Ven. Anandajoti 24) The reduplication of the adverb gives it a distributive sense, *in whatever way*.

.. [AFn25] (Ven. Anandajoti 25) Comm: *herein, there are four kinds of full awareness: full awareness of the purpose [of going], full awareness of the suitability [of going], full awareness of resort [where one is going], full awareness of non-delusion [while going]*.

.. [AFn26] (Ven. Anandajoti 26) This section emphasises that on all occasions during one’s daily life one can maintain mindfulness, as long as one keeps in mind the true nature of the body, and doesn’t cling to it, but that is only possible if one doesn’t get caught up in daily activities, and therefore forgetful of the nature of reality.

.. [AFn27] (Ven. Anandajoti 27) As noted in the Introduction it appears from the other versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna practice in the Pāḷi discourses and from comparative studies of the texts in the early traditions that this section on replulsiveness is the only original section in Kāyānupassanā, which means that the rest of the meditations described in the discourse are later additions, which gives it special relevance. It should also be noted that traditionally the subject for meditation (*kammaṭṭhāna*) described here (*hairs of the head, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin*, etc.) is the first subject given to a newly ordained monastic, and may be taken as an introduction to the practice of mindfulness right at the beginning of the monastic’s life.

.. [AFn28] (Ven. Anandajoti 28) Only adds *the brain*, here and in the repetition below, which is an addition to the formula made in Medieval times. The list up to this point is of the items that have a preponderance of the earth-element, the ones after this point have a preponderance of the water-element.

.. [AFn29] (Ven. Anandajoti 29) This is, of course, merely meant to be indicative of the sort of things found in the body, not a comprehensive list thereof, as can also be confirmed from the simile below where examples of grain are given, not a complete list of all known grains.

.. [AFn30] (Ven. Anandajoti 30) 1 A charnel ground is a place where bodies were left on the ground, sometimes elevated ground, to be devoured by animals or birds.

.. [AFn31] (Ven. Anandajoti 31) More exactly, *vinīlaka* means *blue-coloured*.

.. [AFn32] (Ven. Anandajoti 32) In most countries these days there are no charnel grounds and it is not so easy to find abandoned bodies to do this practice, so monks in Buddhist countries often visit morgues or dissection rooms in hospitals. If actual dead bodies are not available, it is always possible to use one’s imagination. The point of the exercise is not morbidity, but insight, so a degree of spiritual maturity and stability should be established before attempting the practice, which should preferably be done under the guidance of an experienced teacher. Monks in the time of the Buddha who did this practice without guidance started killing themselves (see the opening to Pārājika III in the Vinaya Suttavibhaṅga).

.. [AFn33] (Ven. Anandajoti 33) ChS has an expanded list, which includes *herons*, *tigers*, and *leopards*.

.. [AFn34] (Ven. Anandajoti 34) Literally: *scattered in the main and intermediate directions*.

.. [AFn35] (Ven. Anandajoti 35) There are many variations in the lists given in the various editions here. BJT adds: *ankle-bone*; *shoulder-bone*; *neck-bone* and *tooth-bone*. ChS is different in content and order, and also in spelling in some cases: *ankle-bone, rib-bone, shoulder-bone, neck-bone and jaw-bone*. Similar variations occur in Only which adds: *rib-bone, chest-bone, arm-bone, shoulder-bone, neck-bone, jaw-bone and tooth*.

.. [BpitFn016] (BurmaPiṭakaA 016) Towards the object of concentration

.. [BpitFn017] (BurmaPiṭakaA 017) No special effort is necessary to calm down the strong inhalation and exhalation. The more one gets mental concentration the more the strong inhalation and exhalation will calm down. When the mental concentration reaches its highest point, inhalation and exhalation will become so delicate that the yogi will feel that his breathing has stopped.

.. [BpitFn018] (BurmaPiṭakaA 018) On the string turning the lathe

.. [BpitFn019] (BurmaPiṭakaA 019) I.e., it is his own breathing, and he perceives its impermanent, insecure, and soulless nature.

.. [BpitFn020] (BurmaPiṭakaA 020) Which is the breathing

.. [BpitFn021] (BurmaPiṭakaA 021) His own breathing

.. [BpitFn022] (BurmaPiṭakaA 022) The causes of the appearing and dissolution of the aggregate of physical phenomena which is inhalation and exhalation are the existence or the non-existence of the body, the nose and the mind.

.. [BpitFn023] (BurmaPiṭakaA 023) Which is inhaling and exhaling

.. [BpitFn024] (BurmaPiṭakaA 024) I.e.,vipassanā

.. [BpitFn025] (BurmaPiṭakaA 025) And perceives its impermanent, insecure, soulless, and repulsive nature.

.. [BpitFn026] (BurmaPiṭakaA 026) The causes of appearing of physical phenomena are ignorance of the Four Ariya Truths, craving, kamma, and nutriment. They and their effect, i.e., the continuous appearance of physical phenomena, are called five Samudaya dhammā. The perception of these five Samudaya dhammā is called Samudaya dhammānupassi. They are perceived in the following way:

              When the bhikkhu can steadfastly keep his mind on the body-postures by means of diligence, mindfulness, concentration, comprehension, he perceives the sign or incessant appearance of physical phenomena (nibbatti lakkhaṇā): This perception usually begins, when the bhikkhu achieves the second vipassanā ñāṇa — paccaya pariggaha ñāṇa. From this perception, the bhikkhu draws the conclusion that rebirth of beings take place in a similar way.

              Therefore, while the bhikkhu is perceiving the continuous appearance of physical phenomena he realizes that endless rebirths are due to:

              (1) ignorance of Four Ariya Truths;

              (2) craving for pleasure of the senses; 

              (3) kamma (deeds, words and thoughts) which has the potency for rebirth as its effect; 

              (4) nutriment which is essential for physical phenomena; 

              (5) mind (citta) which is the motivating force; 

              (6) heat and cold. The causes of dissolution of physical phenomena are the absence of the above factors. 

              The bhikkhu then realizes that extinction of ignorance of Four Ariya Truths will cause the extinction of endless appearance of physical phenomena. The actual perception of the sign of change or disappearance or deterioration of physical phenomena will begin when the bhikkhu achieves the third vipassanā ñāṇa — Sammasana ñāṇa. The sign of change is called viparinama lakkhaṇā. In fact, the perception of the appearance and disappearance of physical phenomena, by means of nibbatti and viparināma lakkhaṇā, becomes clearer when the bhikkhu achieves the fourth vipassanā ñāṇa — Udayabbaya ñāṇa. However, the perception of only the disappearance of physical phenomena becomes stronger, when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa — bhaṅga ñāṇa.

.. [BpitFn027] (BurmaPiṭakaA 027) "Without soul or atta directing it" — this shows the mental state of the bhikkhu when his mindfulness is at its height. Before he reaches this mental state, he occasionally imagines, in spite of his efforts to be mindful, (a) that body and limbs are his, (b) that his jīva (soul or atta) is directing them, to make postures. Occasionally, he even feels proud of and pleased with "his" body and limbs." \   These false views of the body and limbs begin to disappear when he achieves the fifth vipassanā ñāṇa — bhaṅga ñāṇa. From that stage the bhikkhu perceives only the deterioration of the body. And he is no longer conscious of the body and the limbs as such. And therefore he does not take pride and pleasure in them. \   With this perception of the non-existence of the body and limbs, he fully achieves the eleventh vipassanā ñāṇa, (saṅkhārupekkhā ñāṇa.)

.. [BpitFn028] (BurmaPiṭakaA 028) I.e.,vipassanā

.. [BpitFn029] (BurmaPiṭakaA 029) Including the pleura, the diaphragm and other forms of membrane in the body

.. [BpitFn032] (BurmaPiṭakaA 032) The primary elements: dhātu, 'element', is a force of Nature which behaves in accordance with the laws of Nature. The four primary elements literally translated above for the sake of brevity as 'earth, water, fire, and air elements' are:

               1. Pathavī-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing hardness. (It is sometimestranslated as the element of solidity or of extension); 

               2. Āpo-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attributes of causing cohesion and of causing fluidity. (It is sometimes translated as the element of cohesion); 

               3. Tejo-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing heat or cold, i.e., thermal energy. (It is sometimes translated as the element of heat);

               4. Vāyo-dhātu: a force of Nature that has the attribute of causing motion or impetus. (It is sometimes translated as the element of motion).

               The Pathavī-dhātu is predominant in the first twenty items of the list given in Section (4). The Āpo-dhātu is predominant in the last twelve items. The Tejo-dhātu consists of four kinds of heat in the body and Vāyo dhātu consists of six kinds of Vāyo in the body.
