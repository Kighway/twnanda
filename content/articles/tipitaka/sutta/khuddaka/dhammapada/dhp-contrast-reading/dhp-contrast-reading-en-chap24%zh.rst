     - CUT OFF CRAVING FROM THE ROOT

       337. This I say to you: Good luck to you all who have assembled here! Dig up the root of craving like one in quest of bīraṇa's sweet root. Let not Māra [NāradaFn24-02]_ crush you again and again as a flood (crushes) a reed.

       |  (Like with weeds), not just the shoot;  
       |  Or else, by Mara you’ll be crushed, 
       |  As floods destroy the weak bulrush.
     
   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_
     - 337 This salutary word I tell you, 'Do ye, as many as are here assembled, dig up the root of thirst, as he who wants the sweet- scented Usira root must dig up the Birana grass, that Mara (the tempter) may not crush you again and again, as the stream crushes the reeds.'

       |  Again and again fresh sorrow will grow.
     
   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_

.. [NāradaFn24-01] (Ven. Nārada 24-01) Craving is threefold, viz: craving for sensual pleasures (kāmataṇhā), craving connected with the notion of eternalism (bhavataṇhā), and craving connected with the notion of nihilism (vibhavataṇhā).

                    Craving for personal sense-fields, such as eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, and for external sense-fields, such as form, sound, scent, taste, contact, and dhammas (mental objects), when viewed in the foregoing three aspects, divides itself into thirty-six varieties. When they are viewed according to past, present, and future they become one hundred and eight.

                    Bhavataṇhā may also be interpreted as attachment to life or Realms of Form, and vibhavataṇhā as attachment to annihilation or Formless Realms.

.. [NāradaFn24-02] (Ven. Nārada 24-02) Passions.

.. [NāradaFn24-03] (Ven. Nārada 24-03) See note on v. 334.

.. [NāradaFn24-04] (Ven. Nārada 24-04) Through the six sense-doors.

.. [NāradaFn24-05] (Ven. Nārada 24-05) That is, from the six sense-doors.

.. [NāradaFn24-06] (Ven. Nārada 24-06) Resting on the six sense-objects.

.. [NāradaFn24-07] (Ven. Nārada 24-07) There are five kinds of bonds (saṅga) - namely: lust, hatred, delusion, pride, and false views.

.. [NāradaFn24-08] (Ven. Nārada 24-08) Here is a pun on the two meanings of vana, forest and desire.

.. [NāradaFn24-09] (Ven. Nārada 24-09) Editor's note: The text here actually reads vajanti dhīrā, as in the following verse; but Ven Nārada translates: 'leave the world' which can only refer to paribbajanti as in other editions.

.. [NāradaFn24-10] (Ven. Nārada 24-10) That is, attachment to the past, present, and future Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn24-11] (Ven. Nārada 24-11) This is the meditation on the impurities of the body by practising which one can get rid of attachment to the body.

.. [NāradaFn24-12] (Ven. Nārada 24-12) Niruttipadakovido - versed in the four kinds of analytical knowledge (pañisambhidā) - namely: meaning (attha), text (dhamma), etymology (nirutti), and understanding (pañibhāna).

.. [NāradaFn24-13] (Ven. Nārada 24-13) Arahantship.

.. [BudRkFn-v339] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 339) The thirty-six currents of craving: the three cravings — for sensual pleasure, for continued existence, and for annihilation — in relation to each of the twelve bases — the six sense organs, including mind, and their corresponding objects.

.. [BudRkFn-v344] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 344) This verse, in the original, puns with the Pali word vana meaning both "desire" and "forest."

.. [BudRkFn-v353] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 353) This was the Buddha's reply to a wandering ascetic who asked him about his teacher. The Buddha's answer shows that Supreme Enlightenment was his own unique attainment, which he had not learned from anyone else.

.. [ThaniSFn-V337] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 337) This verse provides a Buddhist twist to the typical benedictions found in works of kavya. Instead of expressing a wish that the listeners meet with wealth, fame, status, or other worldly forms of good fortune, it describes the highest good fortune, which can be accomplished only through one's own skillful kamma: the uprooting of craving and the resulting state of total freedom from the round of death and rebirth. A similar twist on the theme of good fortune is found in the Mangala Sutta (Khp.5, Sn 2.4), which teaches that the best protective charm is to develop skillful kamma, ultimately developing the mind to the point where it is untouched by the vagaries of the world.

.. [ThaniSFn-V339] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 339) 36 streams = three forms of desire for each of the internal and external sense spheres (see note 294) — 3 x 2 x 6 = 36. According to one sub-commentary, the three forms of desire are desires focused on the present, past, and future. According to another, they are craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, and craving for no-becoming.

.. [ThaniSFn-V340] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 340) "Every which way": Reading sabbadhi with the Thai and Burmese editions. The creeper, according to DhpA, is craving, which sends thoughts out to wrap around its objects, while it itself stays rooted in the mind.

.. [ThaniSFn-V341] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 341) This verse contains an implied simile: the terms "loosened & oiled," here applied to joys, were commonly used to describe smooth bowel movements.

.. [ThaniSFn-V343] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 343) For the various meanings that attano — "for himself" — can have in this verse, see note 402.

.. [ThaniSFn-V346] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 346) "Elastic": The usual translation for sithilam — "slack" — does not fit in this verse, but all the Pali recensions are unanimous on this reading, so I have chosen a near synonym that does. The Patna Dhp renders this term as "subtle," whereas the Tibetan commentary to the Udanavarga explains the line as a whole as meaning "hard for the slack to untie." Both alternatives make sense, but may be attempts to "correct" a term that could well have originally meant "elastic," a meaning that got lost with the passage of time.

.. [ThaniSFn-V348] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 348) DhpA: In front = the aggregates of the past; behind = the aggregates of the future; in between = the aggregates of the present. See also note 385.

.. [ThaniSFn-V350] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 350) "A focus on the foul": A meditative exercise in focusing on the foul parts of the body so as to help undercut lust and attachment for the body. See note 7-8.

.. [ThaniSFn-V352] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 352) "Astute in expression, knowing the combination of sounds — which comes first & which after": Some arahants, in addition to their ability to overcome all of their defilements, are also endowed with four forms of acumen (patisambhida), one of which is acumen with regard to expression (nirutti-patisambhida), i.e., a total mastery of linguistic expression. This talent in particular must have been of interest to the anthologist(s) who put together the Dhp.

                     "Last-body": Because an arahant will not be reborn, this present body is his/her last.

.. [ThaniSFn-V353] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 353) According to MN 26 and Mv I.6.7, one of the first people the Buddha met after his Awakening was an ascetic who commented on the clarity of his faculties and asked who his teacher was. This verse was part of the Buddha's response.

.. [ThaniSFn-V354] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 354) This verse contains several terms related to aesthetics. Both dhamma (justice) and dana (gift/generosity) are sub-types of the heroic rasa, or savor. (See the Introduction.) The third sub-type of the heroic — yuddha (warfare) — is suggested by the verb "conquer," which occurs four times in the Pali. Rati (delight/love) is the emotion (bhava) that corresponds to the sensitive rasa. In effect, the verse is saying that the highest forms of rasa and emotion are those related to Dhamma; the highest expression of the heroic Dhamma rasa is in the ending of craving.

.. [VaradoFn-V340] (Ven. Varado V.340) Verse 340: "A river courses far and wide/ The creeping vine, where it sprouts it abides". I take this to mean that although sensation (vedana) courses far and wide, free of attachment, like a river, clinging is static, like a vine.  

.. [VaradoFn-V341] (Ven. Varado V.341) Verse 341: My translation of the first line has been largely guided by the context of the second line. 

.. [VaradoFn-V344] (Ven. Varado V.344) Verse 344: "wood/would" reflects the Pali "vana/vana" word-play. 

.. [VaradoFn-V346] (Ven. Varado V.346) Verse 346: "easy to don" (ohārinaṃ sithilaṃ). Comments in PED suggest this can be translated as "yielding to take down". 

.. [VaradoFn-V352] (Ven. Varado V.352) Verse 352:
