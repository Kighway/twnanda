**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn24-01] (Ven. Nārada 24-01) Craving is threefold, viz: craving for sensual pleasures (kāmataṇhā), craving connected with the notion of eternalism (bhavataṇhā), and craving connected with the notion of nihilism (vibhavataṇhā).

                    Craving for personal sense-fields, such as eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, and for external sense-fields, such as form, sound, scent, taste, contact, and dhammas (mental objects), when viewed in the foregoing three aspects, divides itself into thirty-six varieties. When they are viewed according to past, present, and future they become one hundred and eight.

                    Bhavataṇhā may also be interpreted as attachment to life or Realms of Form, and vibhavataṇhā as attachment to annihilation or Formless Realms.

.. [NāradaFn24-02] (Ven. Nārada 24-02) Passions.

.. [NāradaFn24-03] (Ven. Nārada 24-03) See note on v. 334.

.. [NāradaFn24-04] (Ven. Nārada 24-04) Through the six sense-doors.

.. [NāradaFn24-05] (Ven. Nārada 24-05) That is, from the six sense-doors.

.. [NāradaFn24-06] (Ven. Nārada 24-06) Resting on the six sense-objects.

.. [NāradaFn24-07] (Ven. Nārada 24-07) There are five kinds of bonds (saṅga) - namely: lust, hatred, delusion, pride, and false views.

.. [NāradaFn24-08] (Ven. Nārada 24-08) Here is a pun on the two meanings of vana, forest and desire.

.. [NāradaFn24-09] (Ven. Nārada 24-09) Editor's note: The text here actually reads vajanti dhīrā, as in the following verse; but Ven Nārada translates: 'leave the world' which can only refer to paribbajanti as in other editions.

.. [NāradaFn24-10] (Ven. Nārada 24-10) That is, attachment to the past, present, and future Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn24-11] (Ven. Nārada 24-11) This is the meditation on the impurities of the body by practising which one can get rid of attachment to the body.

.. [NāradaFn24-12] (Ven. Nārada 24-12) Niruttipadakovido - versed in the four kinds of analytical knowledge (pañisambhidā) - namely: meaning (attha), text (dhamma), etymology (nirutti), and understanding (pañibhāna).

.. [NāradaFn24-13] (Ven. Nārada 24-13) Arahantship.

.. [BudRkFn-v339] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 339) The thirty-six currents of craving: the three cravings — for sensual pleasure, for continued existence, and for annihilation — in relation to each of the twelve bases — the six sense organs, including mind, and their corresponding objects.

.. [BudRkFn-v344] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 344) This verse, in the original, puns with the Pali word vana meaning both "desire" and "forest."

.. [BudRkFn-v353] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 353) This was the Buddha's reply to a wandering ascetic who asked him about his teacher. The Buddha's answer shows that Supreme Enlightenment was his own unique attainment, which he had not learned from anyone else.

.. [ThaniSFn-V337] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 337) This verse provides a Buddhist twist to the typical benedictions found in works of kavya. Instead of expressing a wish that the listeners meet with wealth, fame, status, or other worldly forms of good fortune, it describes the highest good fortune, which can be accomplished only through one's own skillful kamma: the uprooting of craving and the resulting state of total freedom from the round of death and rebirth. A similar twist on the theme of good fortune is found in the Mangala Sutta (Khp.5, Sn 2.4), which teaches that the best protective charm is to develop skillful kamma, ultimately developing the mind to the point where it is untouched by the vagaries of the world.

.. [ThaniSFn-V339] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 339) 36 streams = three forms of desire for each of the internal and external sense spheres (see note 294) — 3 x 2 x 6 = 36. According to one sub-commentary, the three forms of desire are desires focused on the present, past, and future. According to another, they are craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, and craving for no-becoming.

.. [ThaniSFn-V340] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 340) "Every which way": Reading sabbadhi with the Thai and Burmese editions. The creeper, according to DhpA, is craving, which sends thoughts out to wrap around its objects, while it itself stays rooted in the mind.

.. [ThaniSFn-V341] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 341) This verse contains an implied simile: the terms "loosened & oiled," here applied to joys, were commonly used to describe smooth bowel movements.

.. [ThaniSFn-V343] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 343) For the various meanings that attano — "for himself" — can have in this verse, see note 402.

.. [ThaniSFn-V346] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 346) "Elastic": The usual translation for sithilam — "slack" — does not fit in this verse, but all the Pali recensions are unanimous on this reading, so I have chosen a near synonym that does. The Patna Dhp renders this term as "subtle," whereas the Tibetan commentary to the Udanavarga explains the line as a whole as meaning "hard for the slack to untie." Both alternatives make sense, but may be attempts to "correct" a term that could well have originally meant "elastic," a meaning that got lost with the passage of time.

.. [ThaniSFn-V348] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 348) DhpA: In front = the aggregates of the past; behind = the aggregates of the future; in between = the aggregates of the present. See also note 385.

.. [ThaniSFn-V350] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 350) "A focus on the foul": A meditative exercise in focusing on the foul parts of the body so as to help undercut lust and attachment for the body. See note 7-8.

.. [ThaniSFn-V352] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 352) "Astute in expression, knowing the combination of sounds — which comes first & which after": Some arahants, in addition to their ability to overcome all of their defilements, are also endowed with four forms of acumen (patisambhida), one of which is acumen with regard to expression (nirutti-patisambhida), i.e., a total mastery of linguistic expression. This talent in particular must have been of interest to the anthologist(s) who put together the Dhp.

                     "Last-body": Because an arahant will not be reborn, this present body is his/her last.

.. [ThaniSFn-V353] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 353) According to MN 26 and Mv I.6.7, one of the first people the Buddha met after his Awakening was an ascetic who commented on the clarity of his faculties and asked who his teacher was. This verse was part of the Buddha's response.

.. [ThaniSFn-V354] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 354) This verse contains several terms related to aesthetics. Both dhamma (justice) and dana (gift/generosity) are sub-types of the heroic rasa, or savor. (See the Introduction.) The third sub-type of the heroic — yuddha (warfare) — is suggested by the verb "conquer," which occurs four times in the Pali. Rati (delight/love) is the emotion (bhava) that corresponds to the sensitive rasa. In effect, the verse is saying that the highest forms of rasa and emotion are those related to Dhamma; the highest expression of the heroic Dhamma rasa is in the ending of craving.

.. [VaradoFn-V340] (Ven. Varado V.340) Verse 340: "A river courses far and wide/ The creeping vine, where it sprouts it abides". I take this to mean that although sensation (vedana) courses far and wide, free of attachment, like a river, clinging is static, like a vine.  

.. [VaradoFn-V341] (Ven. Varado V.341) Verse 341: My translation of the first line has been largely guided by the context of the second line. 

.. [VaradoFn-V344] (Ven. Varado V.344) Verse 344: "wood/would" reflects the Pali "vana/vana" word-play. 

.. [VaradoFn-V346] (Ven. Varado V.346) Verse 346: "easy to don" (ohārinaṃ sithilaṃ). Comments in PED suggest this can be translated as "yielding to take down". 

.. [VaradoFn-V352] (Ven. Varado V.352) Verse 352:   
                    Adept at linguistics (niruttipadakovido) which PED says means "skilled in the dialect or the original language of the holy Scriptures".   
                  
                    Proficient in words and semantics (sannipātaṃ) which PED says means "collocation" i.e. the characteristic combination of words in a language.

                    Skilled in phonetics (akkhara) which PED says means "phonetics which probably included grammar".  
                  
                    Expert in syntax (pubbāparā) which PED says means what precedes and what follows, what comes first and what last, with reference to the successive order of syllables and words in the text of the Scriptures".

.. [DLMBSFn-V334] (DLMBS Commentary V334) A fisherman in Sāvatthi once caught a beautiful golden fish. But when the fish opened its mouth, horrible smell spread all around. The Buddha was asked why this was so. 

    The fish had been a monk named Kapila long time ago. Kapila was very learned and famous. He taught the Dharma to many people. As a result of this he became very conceited and looked down on other monks. Whenever somebody would try to censure him, Kapila would just grow angry. Soon everybody avoided him and that made Kapila even angrier and he developed hatred for the monks and for the Dharma. 

    As a result of his conceit and hatred, he had to suffer for a long time. Because he taught the Dharma to many, he had a beautiful golden body. But because he used his mouth to abuse the monks and the Dharma, his breath was stinky and foul. The Buddha then added this verse (and the three following ones, DhP 335, DhP 336 and DhP 337).

.. [DLMBSFn-V335] (DLMBS Commentary V335) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 334) and the two following verses (DhP 336 and DhP 337). 

    Thirst and craving are one of the main roots of evil, origins of suffering. The more we are in power of craving, the more suffering and sorrow will befall us. To cut off the craving in our minds is to destroy all sorrow and suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V336] (DLMBS Commentary V336) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 334 and DhP 335) and for the following verse (DhP 337). 

    To defeat the thirst and craving is to defeat the suffering and sorrow. It equals the attainment of Awakenment. Only after reaching the goal of Arahantship, is the thirst completely eradicated and the mind is free from sorrow and suffering. In order to do that one must practice meditation diligently, as taught by the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V337] (DLMBS Commentary V337) The fishermen in Sāvatthi once caught a beautiful golden fish. They took it to the king who in turn sent it to the Buddha. When the fish opened its mouth, horrible smell spread all around. 

    When asked about this, the Buddha replied that this fish as a learned monk named Kapila a long time ago, during the times of the Buddha Kassapa. Kapila was learned, but very conceited. He did not stand any criticism from other monks, whom he looked down upon. As a result, the other monks started to avoid him. At one occasion, Kapila was delivering a discourse, but nobody went to attend. Kapila then started to think that Dharma had no meaning at all. Because of this, he was born as a fish with a foul breath. But because he taught the Dharma to many before he became so sour, he had a beautiful golden body. 

    The Buddha then spoke this verse and went on to stress the importance of equally combining theoretical learning with meditation practice.

.. [DLMBSFn-V338] (DLMBS Commentary V338) Once the Buddha saw a female pig and he smiled. Venerable Ānanda asked him about the reason for his smile. The Buddha told him that this pig used to be a hen during the times pf the previous Buddha. The hen lived close to a monastery and as a result listened to the discourses. Later she was reborn as a princess. Once she noticed some worms in the toilet and started to meditate on the repulsiveness of the body. Later she was reborn as a Brahma type of deity. And now again, because of some demerit, she was born as a pig. The Buddha commented in this verse (and the five following ones, DhP 339 - DhP 343) how there was simply no end of the round of existences on account of good and bad karma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V339] (DLMBS Commentary V339) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 338) and for the four following verses (DhP 340 - DhP 343). 

    The thirty-six streams in this verse are the three types of craving (for sensual pleasure, for eternal existence, for non-existence) in relation to each of six sense organs that the Buddhist psychology works with: eye, nose, ears, tongue, body and mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V340] (DLMBS Commentary V340) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 338 and DhP 339) and with the three following verses (DhP 341, DhP 342 and DhP 343). 

    The streams in this verse are identical with the thirty-six streams from the previous verse (DhP 339). The creeper means passion. It has to be cut off completely with the wisdom gained in meditation practice in order to enable us to reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V341] (DLMBS Commentary V341) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the three previous verses (DhP 338, Dhp 339 and Dhp 340) and for the two following verses (DhP 342 and DhP 343). 

    Our senses bring in all kinds of data. We are attached to the pleasures coming from these senses. Because of that, we create positive and negative karma and this karma will come into fruition in the future as more births and deaths for us. The solution is to cut off the attachment to this pleasure and with equanimity concentrate on the highest goal, the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V342] (DLMBS Commentary V342) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the four previous verses (DhP 338, DhP 339, DhP 340 and DhP 341) and for the following verse (DhP 343). 

    There are ten fetters (**saṃyojana**). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. 
  
    The five big fetters are:

    1) personality belief (**sakkāya-diṭṭhi**), 
    2) skeptical doubt (**vicikicchā**), 
    3) clinging to rules and rituals (**sīlabbata-paramāsa**), 
    4) sensuous craving (**kāma-rāga**), 
    5) ill-will (**vyāpāda**).

    The five small fetters are:
     
    1) craving for fine-material existence (**rūpa-rāga**), 
    2) craving for immaterial existence (**arūpa-rāga**), 
    3) conceit (**māna**), 
    4) restlessness (**uddhacca**), 
    5) ignorance (**avijjā**). 

.. [DLMBSFn-V343] (DLMBS Commentary V343) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the five previous verses (DhP 338, DhP 339, DhP 340, DhP 341 and DhP 342). 
    Because of craving people "crawl around" from existence into existence. Just like a captured hare tries very hard to escape but the fetter is stronger, so it manages only to cut itself. People also try to be free but do it the wrong way, only falling more and more deeply into the snare of passions and repeated existence. The solution is to remove all the passion and thirst and escape the snare of *Samsara* forever.

.. [DLMBSFn-V344] (DLMBS Commentary V344) A certain monk was a pupil of Venerable Mahā Kassapa. Although he did not reach any stage of Awakenment, he was able to achieve the four mental absorptions (**jhāna**). Once he visited his uncle who was a goldsmith and developed a strong craving for the gold ornaments he saw there. Therefore he left the Order and came to live with his uncle. 

    But because he was lazy, his uncle threw him out of the house. The man became a thief. After some time he was caught and sentenced to execution. At the execution ground he did not show any fear at all and established himself in deep mental absorption. When the executioners saw that they were very surprised and informed the king. The king gave the order to release the man. 

    The Buddha then admonished the monk with this verse, showing him how foolish it was to leave the monk's life. He further instructed the man in the meditation of insight. The man reached the first stage of Awakenment. Later he rejoined the Order and soon reached the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V345] (DLMBS Commentary V345) A group of monks once went to the city of Sāvatthi for almsfood. On their way they observed some prisoners being led with their hands and legs chained in bonds. When they returned to the monastery they related the matter to the Buddha. 

    The Buddha spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 346) and explained that passion and craving were much stronger fetters than all the chains and handcuffs.

.. [DLMBSFn-V346] (DLMBS Commentary V346) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 345). 

    All the man-made fetters like iron handcuffs, ropes and wooden bonds can not equal craving and longing for beautiful things and loved persons. Bond by these fetters, all beings crawl from existence to existence, unable to break free. Only through abandoning this craving can we be free from the fetters of *Samsara*. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V347] (DLMBS Commentary V347) Queen Khemā was the wife of king Bimbisāra. She was very beautiful and proud of her beauty. The king wanted her to go to the monastery and listen to the Buddha's discourse. But Khemā knew that the Buddha often talked about impermanency and non-attachment to the body, she did not dare to go to see him. 

    Finally the king ordered his musicians to play a song praising the Veluvana monastery and the queen decided to go. She sat in the audience while the Buddha was expounding the teaching. The Buddha then created a vision of a female form (which was visible only to Khemā) to sit near him on the stage, where he was delivering his speech and to fan him. The girl was very young and extremely beautiful. Khemā saw her and realized that compared to this girl she herself looked like a monkey. 

    While she was looking, the girl began to grow older. She became a young woman, then a grown up woman, middle aged, old - and finally she became a very old woman. Khemā realized that the change of the body is a continuing process and she found out that this beautiful young girl changed into an old ugly woman. Then the woman on stage, no longer able to control her body, was lying there, dying and finally she died. Her body got swollen and worms were all over it. 

    Khemā thus finally realized that also her beauty was very impermanent - it was subjected to illness, old age and death. The Buddha further instructed her with this verse and at the end Khemā attained Arahantship. Later she joined the order and became the chief female disciple of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V348] (DLMBS Commentary V348) Once a group of wandering acrobats came to Rājagaha. A young man named Uggasena fell in love with a beautiful dancer from the troupe. He married her and joined the group. But since he was not an acrobat, he could only help carry boxes, drive carts and perform similar tasks. 

    The girl gave birth to a son later but she often scolded her husband for not being able to do anything better. Uggasena therefore learned the secrets of acrobatics and became a very skilful acrobat himself. 

    One day the group returned to Rājagaha. Uggasena was eager to perform as he expected to be applauded for his skills. Just as he was performing, the Buddha passed near the place and all the attention of the crowd was drawn to him. Uggasena just sat there feeling very depressed. The Buddha told him this verse and Uggasena reached the Awakenment there and then. He became a monk immediately. 

    Later the Buddha told Uggasena's story. A long time ago, during the times of the Buddha Kassapa, Uggasena gave almsfood to a monk and made a wish that he could reach Arahantship one day. The monk was an Arahant and looked into the future and smiled, because he was able to see that his wish would be fulfilled. Uggasena misunderstood the monk's smile and thought the monk was laughing at him. Therefore he became angry. Because of that he had to travel with a group of acrobats for some time before reaching his goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V349] (DLMBS Commentary V349) A young monk once asked for some water in a house where a young woman lived alone. She fell in love with him immediately and invited him to come over for almsfood anytime he wanted. Later she would hint that she had enough money but felt very lonely. The monk felt himself attracted to her and began contemplating leaving the Order and marrying her. He became thin and nervous because of his thoughts and the matter was reported to the Buddha. 

    The Buddha told the monk that in his previous life this woman was his wife. Once they were traveling and met some thieves. She fell in love with their leader and helped him kill her husband. Just like in the previous life she was the source of his death, so in this life she could well be the ruin of his life as a monk. The Buddha then spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 350). 
    The monk took the advice to his heart and began striving diligently towards the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V350] (DLMBS Commentary V350) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 349). 

    The more we think about the pleasant things, the more we desire them. The thirst and attachment will grow. We should also reflect on the unpleasant and impure things in order to restrain our thirst and craving. In this way, we will be able to cut off the fetters that bind us to this world and we can reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V351] (DLMBS Commentary V351) A large group of monks came to visit the Jetavana monastery. The Buddha's son, novice Rāhula had to sleep outside. Mara then took the form of an elephant and tried to scare Rāhula. But Rāhula did not show any trace of fear. The Buddha then came out and told Mara this verse (and the following one, DhP 352) telling him that Rāhula was an Arahant and could not be scared by anything in the world. Mara realized he lost and disappeared.

.. [DLMBSFn-V352] (DLMBS Commentary V352) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 351). 

    At the time of the Buddha, the sacred texts of various religions were not supposed to be written down. It was considered a kind of sacrilege to do that. Writing was reserved only for worldly matters. Therefore it was crucial that the texts were always remembered correctly and without alteration, in order to protect the true words of the teacher without his disciples changing the meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V353] (DLMBS Commentary V353) Just a short time after the Buddha had reached the Awakenment, he met a wandering ascetic named Upaka. Upaka was very impressed by the Buddha and asked him, who was his teacher. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying he did not have any teacher, but that he reached the Awakenment completely on his own. At the end Upaka said he did neither believed the Buddha nor disbelieved him and just walked away.

.. [DLMBSFn-V354] (DLMBS Commentary V354) The gods were once arguing about four questions: Which is the best of all gifts? Which is the best among tastes? Which is the best of joys? How to conquer all suffering? They could not agree on an answer, so Sakka, the king of gods, went to see the Buddha and asked him these questions. The Buddha replied with this verse. 

    Sakka then requested that he gods be invited to share the merit accumulated by the gift of Dharma. The Buddha agreed and from that time on it is a custom to invite the gods to partake of the merit whenever a good deed is done.

.. [DLMBSFn-V355] (DLMBS Commentary V355) King of Kosala came to see the Buddha once and told him that a rich old man died that day in Sāvatthi. He did not leave any heirs and so all his wealth was taken to the state treasury. He also related that the man was very stingy and did not give anything in charity. 

    The Buddha then revealed that this man was also very rich in one of his past existences. Once he offered some almsfood to a monk but then in his stinginess regretted his deed. His brother who was also very rich had a son and this man killed the young boy in order to inherit all his brother's wealth. Because of that these deeds he suffered for a long time. In this present existence he did nothing to accumulate merit and therefore missed a good opportunity to do good with his wealth.

.. [DLMBSFn-V356] (DLMBS Commentary V356) When the Buddha's mother died, she became a goddess named Santusitā in the Tāvatimsa heaven. When the Buddha attained the Awakenment, he went there to teach her the Dharma. While he was there, he also met two other gods. One of them, Indaka, was a man in his previous existence, who once offered a little almsfood to Venerable Anuruddha, the Buddha's disciple. The other god, Ankura, had given much almsfood in his lifetime as a human being, but none of the almsfood was to truly Awakened people. Ankura asked the Buddha how was it possible, that he had given so much and still was reborn in the same heaven as Indaka, who gave almsfood only once. The Buddha then replied with this verse (and three following ones, DhP 357, DhP 358 and DhP 359), saying that quality is more important than quantity.

.. [DLMBSFn-V357] (DLMBS Commentary V357) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 356) and the two following verses (DhP 358, DhP 359). 

    Giving alms is very important, but we must also differentiate to whom we give. The gifts to those who are free of attachments bring much more fruit than what we give to someone who is enslaved by passion, hatred and ignorance.

.. [DLMBSFn-V358] (DLMBS Commentary V358) The story for this verse is identical with the one for two previous verses (DhP 356 and DhP 357) and for the following verse (DhP 359).

.. [DLMBSFn-V359] (DLMBS Commentary V359) The story for this verse is identical with the one for three previous verses (DhP 356, DhP 357 and DhP 358). 

    By these four verses the Buddha stresses the importance of giving alms to those who really deserve it. To give alms to those who are just lazy to work for their living will do harm to the society as well as to those people in question.
