   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_
     - 165 By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity belong to oneself, no one can purify another.

**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn12-01] (Ven. Nārada 12-01) According to Buddhism there is no permanent soul or unchanging entity (atta) either created by a God or emanating from a Paramātma. Here the term atta (self) is applied to the whole body, or one's personality, or mind, or life flux.

.. [NāradaFn12-02] (Ven. Nārada 12-02) Will not be blamed by others.

.. [NāradaFn12-03] (Ven. Nārada 12-03)  Here "welfare" denotes one's ultimate goal, i.e., Nibbāna. Personal sanctification should not be sacrificed for the sake of external homage.

                    One must not misunderstand this verse to mean that one should not selflessly work for the weal of others. Selfless service is highly commended by the Buddha.

.. [BudRkFn-v164]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 164) Certain reeds of the bamboo family perish immediately after producing fruits.

.. [ThaniSFn-V157] (Ven. Thanissaro V.157) "The three watches of the night": this is the literal meaning of the verse, but DhpA shows that the image of staying up to nurse someone in the night is meant to stand for being wakeful and attentive throughout the three stages of life: youth, middle age, and old age. The point here is that it is never too early or too late to wake up and begin nurturing the good qualities of mind that will lead to one's true benefit. On this point, see A 3.51 & 52, where the Buddha counsels two old brahmans, nearing the end of their life span, to begin practicing generosity along with restraint in thought, word, and deed.

.. [ThaniSFn-V162] (Ven. Thanissaro V.162) DhpA completes the image of the poem by saying that one's vice brings about one's own downfall, just as a maluva creeper ultimately brings about the downfall of the tree it overspreads. See note 42.

.. [ThaniSFn-V164] (Ven. Thanissaro V.164) A bamboo plant bears fruit only once and then dies soon after.

.. [ThaniSFn-V165] (Ven. Thanissaro V.165) "No one purifies another. No other purifies one." These are the two meanings of the one phrase, nañño aññam visodhaye.

.. [ThaniSFn-V166] (Ven. Thanissaro V.166) AN 4.95 lists four types of people in descending order: those devoted to their own true welfare as well as that of others, those devoted to their own true welfare but not that of others, those devoted to the true welfare of others but not their own, and those devoted neither to their own true welfare nor that of others. SN 47.19 makes the point that if one is truly devoted to one's own welfare, others automatically benefit, in the same way that an acrobat maintaining his/her own balance helps his/her partner stay balanced as well.
