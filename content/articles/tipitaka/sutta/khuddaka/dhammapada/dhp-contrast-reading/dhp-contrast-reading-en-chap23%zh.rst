**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn23-02] (Ven. Nārada 23-02) Sudantena by the development of the Noble Path.

.. [NāradaFn23-03] (Ven. Nārada 23-03) Sahāyatā. By this term are meant morality, austere practices, insight, Paths, Fruits and Nibbāna. (Commentary) See v. 61.

.. [NāradaFn23-04] (Ven. Nārada 23-04) Matteyyatā does not mean motherhood or "to have a mother". The Commentarial explanation is good conduct (sammā-pañipatti) towards the mother, that is, ministering to the mother. The other terms are similarly explained.

.. [NāradaFn23-05] (Ven. Nārada 23-05) The Buddha, the Arahants, and so on.

.. [ThaniSFn-V324] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 324) DhpA: Dhanapalaka was a noble elephant captured for the king of Kasi. Although given palatial quarters with the finest food, he showed no interest, but thought only of the sorrow his mother felt, alone in the elephant wood, separated from her son.

.. [ThaniSFn-V329-330] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 329-330) DhpA: The bull elephant named Matanga, reflecting on the inconveniences of living in a herd crowded with she-elephants and young elephants — he was pushed around as he went into the river, had to drink muddied water, had to eat leaves that others had already nibbled, etc. — decided that he would find more pleasure in living alone. His story parallels that of the elephant in AN 9.40 and elephant the Buddha met in the Parileyyaka Forest (Mv X.4.6-7).
