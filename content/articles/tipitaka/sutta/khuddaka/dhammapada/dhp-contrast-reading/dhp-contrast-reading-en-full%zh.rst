**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn01-01]  (Ven. Nārada 01-01) Yamaka means a pair. This chapter is so named because it consists of ten pairs of parallel verses.

.. [NāradaFn01-02]  (Ven. Nārada 01-02) "Things are forerun by mind" - Mrs. Rhys Davids. "(The mental) natures are the result of what we have thought" - Radhakrishnan. "All that we are is the result of what we have thought" - Irving Babbit.

.. [NāradaFn01-03]  (Ven. Nārada 01-03) These two parallel verses were uttered by the Buddha on two different occasions to show the inevitable effects of evil and good Kamma respectively.

                    Man reaps what he has sown in the past or in the present. What he sows now he reaps in the present or in the future at the opportune moment. Man himself is mainly responsible for his own happiness and misery. He creates his own hell and heaven. He is the architect of his own fate. What he makes he can unmake.

                    Buddhism teaches self-responsibility and the inevitability of the law of cause and effect. What one reaps accords with what one has sown but one is not bound to reap the effects of all that one has sown. If one were, emancipation would become an impossibility.

.. [NāradaFn01-04]  (Ven. Nārada 01-04) The Buddha's constant advice to His followers is not to retaliate but to practise patience at all times, at all places, even under provocation. The Buddha extols those who bear and forbear the wrongs of others though they have the power to retaliate. In the Dhammapada itself there are many instances to show how the Buddha practised patience even when He was severely criticised, abused, and attacked. Patience is not a sign of weakness or defeatism but the unfailing strength of great men and women.

.. [NāradaFn01-05]  (Ven. Nārada 01-05) Avera, literally, means non-anger. Here it means the virtue opposed to the vice of anger, that is, loving-kindness (Mettà).

.. [NāradaFn01-06]  (Ven. Nārada 01-06) Sanantana an ancient principle followed by the Buddha and His disciples. (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn01-07]  (Ven. Nārada 01-07) The quarrelsome persons.

.. [NāradaFn01-08]  (Ven. Nārada 01-08) Yamàmase; derived from yam, to perish, or to restrain.

.. [NāradaFn01-09]  (Ven. Nārada 01-09) The first line may also be rendered thus: Others do not know that here we must restrain ourselves. "The world does not know that we must all come to an end here" - Max Muller, "People do not discern that here we straitened are in life, in time" - Mrs. Rhys Davids.

.. [NāradaFn01-10]  (Ven. Nārada 01-10) Desiring pleasurable sensual objects.

.. [NāradaFn01-11]  (Ven. Nārada 01-11) According to Buddhism there are five kinds of Màras - namely: i. the five Aggregates (khandha), ii. moral and immoral activities (abhisaïkhàra), iii. death (maccu), iv. passions (kilesa), and v. Màra the deity (devaputta). Here the term Màra is used in the sense of passions.

.. [NāradaFn01-12]  (Ven. Nārada 01-12) The thirty-two impurities of the body such as hair, hair of the skin, nails, teeth, skin, etc. To overcome lust, meditation on the impurities of the body is recommended.

.. [NāradaFn01-13]  (Ven. Nārada 01-13) Saddhà is faith in the Buddha (the Teacher), the Dhamma (the Teaching) and the Sangha (the Order), based on knowledge. There is no blind faith in Buddhism. One is not expected to accept anything on mere unreasoning faith.

.. [NāradaFn01-14]  (Ven. Nārada 01-14) These two verses are meant exclusively for Bhikkhus who lead the Holy Life. The first verse indicates the worldly path of sense-gratification; the second, the spiritual path of sense-control and asceticism. It should be noted that Buddhism offers one way of life to the monks and another to the laity.

.. [NāradaFn01-15]  (Ven. Nārada 01-15) Kasàva means stains of passion. Kàsàva means a dyed robe, the outward symbol of renunciation. Robes of monks are dyed to make them valueless. Here is a play on words. External mark of the Holy Life is of no consequence without internal purity. On another occasion the Buddha remarked that a pure person is indeed an ideal recluse or Bhikkhu, irrespective of his external apparel. See v. 142.

.. [NāradaFn01-16]  (Ven. Nārada 01-16) Sàra means the core or essence. Asàra are the unessentials like the necessaries of life, false beliefs, etc. Sàra are the essentials like right beliefs, (sammà diññhi) morality (sãla), concentration (samàdhi), wisdom (pa¤¤à), etc. The essence of the Holy Life cannot be achieved by caring for unessentials.

                    In the Mahà Sàropama Sutta (Majjhima Nikàya, No. 29) the Buddha has compared the leaves and branches of a tree to gain and fame, the bark to morality, the greenwood to concentration, the fruits to the five kinds of super-intellect (abhi¤¤à) and the core to Arahantship.

.. [NāradaFn01-17]  (Ven. Nārada 01-17) Such as lust (kàma), illwill (vyàpàda), and harmfulness (vihi§sà)

.. [NāradaFn01-18]  (Ven. Nārada 01-18) Such as renunciation or non-attachment (nekkhamma), loving-kindness (avyàpàda), and harmlessness (avihi§sà). These pure thoughts constitute the second factor of the Noble Eightfold Path.

.. [NāradaFn01-19]  (Ven. Nārada 01-19) Bhàvita§, lit., made to become, i.e., trained, cultivated, developed. Mind is trained by concentration, which leads to one-pointedness of the mind and mental purification, and by contemplation, which leads to the understanding of things as they truly are. The ultimate goal of a Buddhist is achieved by these two stages of mental development. As physical exercise is to the body, so is meditation to the mind. A well-developed mind is not easily dominated by passions.

.. [NāradaFn01-20]  (Ven. Nārada 01-20) Repenting over his evil deeds, he suffers mentally.

.. [NāradaFn01-21]  (Ven. Nārada 01-21) Experiencing the effects of his evil deeds.

.. [NāradaFn01-22]  (Ven. Nārada 01-22) Reflecting on his good action.

.. [NāradaFn01-23]  (Ven. Nārada 01-23) Reaping the desirable results of his good deeds.

.. [NāradaFn01-24]  (Ven. Nārada 01-24) According to Buddhism the subsequent birth is determined by the thought process at the moment of death. Buddhists do not believe that the earth is the only habitable plane and that human beings are the only beings. Planes are numerous and beings are innumerable. After death one may be born as a human being or in a subhuman state or in a celestial plane according to one's actions. The so-called being in the subsequent life is neither the same as its predecessor (as it has changed) nor absolutely different (as it is the identical stream of life). Buddhism denies an identical being but affirms an identity in process.

.. [NāradaFn01-25]  (Ven. Nārada 01-25) Duggati is a woeful state and Sugati is a blissful state. Rebirths in all such states are temporary.

.. [NāradaFn01-26]  (Ven. Nārada 01-26) Sahita§ = saha + hita§, is that which is associated with what is beneficial. Commentary states that sahita§ is a synonym for the Tipiñaka, the three Baskets, taught by the Buddha, namely: Vinaya Piñaka, the Basket of Discipline, Sutta Piñaka, the Basket of Discourses, and Abhidhamma Piñaka, the Basket of Ultimate Doctrine.

.. [NāradaFn01-27]  (Ven. Nārada 01-27) The blessings of a monk are the four stages of Sainthood - namely: Sotàpatti, Stream Winner, Sakadàgàmi, Once-Returner, Anàgàmi, Never-Returner, and Arahanta, the Worthy.

.. [NāradaFn01-28]  (Ven. Nārada 01-28) Sàma¤¤assa = lit. the state of a monk or ascetic, i.e., the Holy life. According to Buddhism learning is of no avail without actual practice.

                    As such Buddhism is not a mere philosophy, but a unique Path of Enlightenment.

.. [BudRkFn01-01]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 01-01) (v. 7) Mara: the Tempter in Buddhism, represented in the scriptures as an evil-minded deity who tries to lead people from the path to liberation. The commentaries explain Mara as the lord of evil forces, as mental defilements and as death.

.. [BudRkFn01-02]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 01-02) (v. 8) The impurities (asubha): subjects of meditation which focus on the inherent repulsiveness of the body, recommended especially as powerful antidotes to lust.

.. [ThaniSFn-V1-2] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 1-2) The fact that the word mano is paired here with dhamma would seem to suggest that it is meant in its role as "intellect," the sense medium that conveys knowledge of ideas or mental objects (two possible meanings for the word dhamma). However, the illustrations in the second sentence of each verse show that it is actually meant in its role as the mental factor responsible for the quality of one's actions (as in mano-kamma), the factor of will and intention, shaping not only mental events, but also physical reality (on this point, see `SN 35.145 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.145.than.html>`_ ). Thus, following a Thai tradition, I have rendered it here as "heart."

                   The images in these verses are carefully chosen. The cart, representing suffering, is a burden on the ox pulling it, and the weight of its wheels obliterates the ox's track. The shadow, representing happiness, is no weight on the body at all.

                   All Pali recensions of this verse give the reading, manomaya = made of the heart, while all other recensions give the reading manojava = impelled by the heart.

.. [ThaniSFn-V7-8]  (Ven. Thanissaro V. 7-8) Focused on the foul: A meditative exercise in focusing on the foul aspects of the body so as to help undercut lust and attachment for the body (see `MN 119 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.119.than.html>`_ ). AN 3.16 gives a standard definition for restraint with the senses: "And how does a monk guard the doors to his sense faculties? There is the case where a monk, on seeing a form with the eye, does not grasp at any theme or particulars by which — if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. He practices with restraint. He guards the faculty of the eye. He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. (Similarly with the ear, nose, tongue, body & intellect.) This is how a monk guards the doors to his sense faculties."

.. [ThaniSFn-V11-12]  (Ven. Thanissaro V. 11-12) Wrong resolves = mental resolves for sensuality, ill will, or harmfulness. Right resolves = mental resolves for freedom from sensuality, for freedom from ill will, and for harmlessness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V17-18]  (Ven. Thanissaro V. 17-18) "Destination" in these two verses and throughout the text means one's destination after death.

.. [VaradoFn01-1]  (Ven. Varado 01-1) Verse 6: "man should live restrained" (yamāmase). PED (yamati): "to control oneself".


.. [DLMBSFn-V001] (DLMBS Commentary V001) In this verse (and the following one, DhP 2) some philosophical observations are made about the nature of our mind. It says that all the mental phenomena, happiness or suffering, joy or sorrow are made by, or are the outcome of, the quality of the mind. These mental phenomena are (according to the teachings of Abhidhamma) feelings (vedanā), perception (saññā) and volitional activities (saṅkhāra). And because these phenomena are created by, or so closely related to, the mind, they are always "colored" in the same way as the mind is. If the mind (as in this verse) is corrupted, full of evil thoughts, then only suffering and sorrow awaits us as a result of this. In other words, the mind, creating these mental phenomena simply creates them "to its own image". Therefore, negative thinking always brings with it suffering and sorrow, just as the wheel follows in the path of the animal carrying the charriot. We experience suffering only because our minds are not purified, we are not awakened. To purify the mind is to get rid of suffering once and for all.

.. [DLMBSFn-V002] (DLMBS Commentary V002) This verse is closely related to the previous one (DhP 1). If the mind is purified, the mental phenomena it creates are also pure. Therefore, joy and happiness follow as surely as suffering and sorrow in case of a defiled mind. As we can see from these two verses, happiness and suffering depends on us entirely, on our own minds, on the thoughts that we are harboring. There is no other way to happiness then purification of mind and ultimately, in destroying all the defilement completely and reaching the highest goal, the awakenment of Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V003] (DLMBS Commentary V003) This verse speaks about the very well known fact, so stressed by the modern psychology. If we succumb to thoughts of injustice done to us, if we always consider ourselves "poor things" that the "strong ones" play with, our suffering and hatred will never disappear, but it will increase, because "they" will feel our insecurity and will enjoy inflicting pain on us even more. "Oh, how could he (or she, for that matter) do this to me? It is so unfair!" By this thinking we will certainly not prevent these things to happen in the future again.

                  How to deal with this situation is spoken about in the following verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V004] (DLMBS Commentary V004) This verse is a "twin verse" of the previous one. If we can not conquer the hatred and suffering by crying and feeling powerless, it is exactly by the absence of such thoughts, that our hatred will disappear and dissolve. And when those people who enjoy making us suffer, see that we are not intimidated and do not give in to their way of thinking, they will eventually stop this kind of behavior.

                  Indeed, it is said very easily and the majority of people will quickly agree with it, but it is extremely difficult to bring this idea to life. Therefore, we must practice this more often in our daily lives -- and our effort must bear its fruits.

.. [DLMBSFn-V005] (DLMBS Commentary V005) This pair of verses (DhP 5 and 6) is very close in meaning to the previous pair (DhP 3 and 4). Again, a very simple truth, that most of the religions in the history have stressed again and again. The only cure for hatred is the abstention from it. Never can we stop people from hating us by hating them. In this way, mutual hatred will rise -- often to the point when hatred gives way to violence.

                  The only way to stop this chain of hatred is to stop hating, of course. As the verse says, this is an eternal law. It was always so and always will be. One can only wish that we could remember this verse in all situations and deal accordingly. How many wars, how much suffering could be easily averted just by taking the advice of this short verse seriously.

.. [DLMBSFn-V006] (DLMBS Commentary V006) This verse is related to the previous one (DhP 5), even if this relation is not apparent immediately. In DhP 5 we are told that hatred can not be appeased by hatred but only by abstention from hatred. Here it says that some people do not understand this, do not know that we should restrain ourselves, that we should not give in to hatred. Those who realize that, of course, stop their enmity and quarreling, thus stopping hatred completely.

                  By the word "others" the authors probably meant the people, who do not realize this eternal law (that hatred can be appeased by non-hatred only). The use of the word "here" ("that we should restrain ourselves here") suggests this world, our present situation. It can also point to the previous verse -- then we should understand "here" as "this" (meaning this eternal law of appeasing hatred by non-hatred).

.. [DLMBSFn-V007] (DLMBS Commentary V007) What we have described here, is a recipe, how to become a prey of our own mind. For Mara, The Evil One, is not some outside force, some "devil" or deity of death and destruction, it is only our mind, our bad habits, laziness, evil intentions and especially ignorance, the true root of all evil. If we dwell with our minds only on the pleasant things, if we indulge in enjoying pleasurable things (subhānupassiṃ viharantaṃ), then it is easy for these tendencies in our brain ("Mara") to gain strength. The same thing happens, when we are unrestrained in six senses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind), taking in without restraint and reflection everything that comes and if we never have enough of sense pleasures (indriyesu asaṃvutaṃ). And of course, if we do not know moderation in food, we can expect the same result, because indulgence in food is actually a part of lack of restraint in senses (bhojanamhi cāmattaññuṃ). Laziness (kusītaṃ) and lack of effort to change our ways (hīnavīriyaṃ) will not help us to get rid of these bad habits and the roots of meditative life will slowly wither and die away. And without strong, often cultivated roots, the tree of our practice will not grow higher and higher, will never bring fruits in reaching the Nirvana, but our bad tendencies will subdue us, our hope for reaching the goal, just as easily, as wind uproots a weak tree.

.. [DLMBSFn-V008] (DLMBS Commentary V008)   Here, on the other hand (in contrast to DhP 7) is described the way, how to nourish the roots of meditative life, how to destroy the bad tendencies, how to become immune to Mara, to the evil part of our mind. We must not dwell with our minds only on the pleasant things and indulge in enjoying pleasurable things (asubhānupassiṃ viharantaṃ). Another way to understand this phrase is that we should contemplate the unpleasant things, to understand that there is really nothing to be attached to, that attachment to pleasant things brings about the strength of "Mara", of our bad habits and tendencies. 
                  
                  We must also be well restrained (indriyesu susaṃvutaṃ) in senses and know moderation in food (bhojanamhi ca mattaññuṃ). Thus, senses are guarded, we do not take everything in indiscriminately, and we contemplate on what we see, hear, smell, taste, touch and think. We are not attached to pleasant sense-impressions, we do not hate unpleasant sense-impressions, and we are observant and concentrated and thus able to bring meditation to everyday life. 
                  
                  Important part is also trust (saddhaṃ). Trust in the way, that the Buddha taught us, trust in the methods that are part of the way, trust in the goal that can be reached by following this way. Without this basic trust (which is not blind faith, for it is easily verified, as we go forward on the way) no progress is possible. 
                  
                  We must also be firm in effort (āraddhavīriyaṃ). Effort is of course a basic necessity. We must make an effort to put everything that was said above into our daily lives. It is only by this constant effort, that we are able to progress towards the goal. 
                  
                  If we practice in this way, the roots of meditation will flourish, will become strong and invincible. Eventually, the tree of our practice will bear its fruit, our mind will reach the peaceful state of Nirvana. Mara, the dark side of our mind has no way to influence us, no way to overcome us, just like the wind is not able to blow away a rocky mountain.

.. [DLMBSFn-V009] (DLMBS Commentary V009) This verse as well as the following one (DhP 10) talks about who is and who is not worthy to wear a monk's robe. One, who did not get rid of defilement (anikkasāvo), who is full of these impurities, who does not know self-control and restraint (dama) and who is far away (apeto) from truth (sacca), does not deserve to wear a yellow robe. Such a person can not call himself a monk, even if he should be dressed in the monk's robe. 

                  As defilement (kasāva) are usually understood so called three roots of evil: lobha (greed), dosa (hatred) and moha (delusion).

.. [DLMBSFn-V010] (DLMBS Commentary V010) In contrast to DhP 9, the person, who deserves to wear a monk's robe is described here. Who "threw up", or got completely rid of, defilement (vantakasāvo), who is well settled and well established in his virtues (sīlesu susamāhito) and who is endowed (upeto) with restraint (dama) and knows the truth (sacca), such a person deserves to wear a yellow monk's robe. Such a person can truly be called a monk.

.. [DLMBSFn-V011] (DLMBS Commentary V011)  One can of course never expect to understand, or get close to, the "essence", the heart of the problem, if one keeps looking in the wrong direction. This is true in every field of our endeavor. Therefore this rule necessarily applies also to spiritual efforts. This verse says that if we mistake the essential things for nonsense and think that there is some essence in things that are actually empty of it, we can not ever get even close to the reality. All kinds of superstition fall into this category, various activities that (although they look nice and can be even pleasant) do not bring us closer to the goal, which is the purification of mind. As the verse notes, this is the "pasture for wrong thoughts". As the cows on the pasture, the thoughts, wandering in this direction, will grow stronger and will multiply. The only problem is -- it will not help us on our way at all.

.. [DLMBSFn-V012] (DLMBS Commentary V012) In contrast to DhP 11, if we really know, what is important and what is empty, if we know, where the essence lies, it is possible for us to discover it. We can take as an example the case if we want to clean the dirty floor. It will not help us to start scrubbing the table. Sure, a clean table is a nice thing, but we wanted the floor to be clean, not the table. In the same way, if we want to purify our mind, we must carefully decide and understand, how to do it, what is the correct procedure. If we know, what is essential in order to reach our goal, then we have a chance of accomplishing it. This is a "pasture for right thoughts". The right thoughts will grow and multiply -- this time only for our benefit.

.. [DLMBSFn-V013] (DLMBS Commentary V013) A roof is the most important part of any house. If the roof is not well done, if we try to "cheat" and use cheap material of poor quality, we can be surprised when a strong rain comes. The roof will not be able to hold off the water and it will leak. Everything inside the house then becomes wet instantly - and after the rain we can start building again.

                  In the same way, the mind is the most important part of the human being. If it is not "well developed", if we have not practiced meditation earnestly, it will also "leak". The passions, hatred and other stuff will enter our mind and make it difficult for us to purify our minds. After one such "rain" we can start "rebuilding" our mind again.

.. [DLMBSFn-V014] (DLMBS Commentary V014) And (continuing from DhP 13) if the roof on our house is well done, if we have made careful plans and executed them well, if we paid enough attention to the roof, then we do not have to be afraid of any rain, no matter how strong. The roof will hold it and the inside of the house will not become flooded, not even wet.

                  And in the case of mind, the same rule applies. If we made a conscious decision to develop it, to keep high level of mindfulness and alert, if we sharpen our mind in meditation, all the passions have no way of entering. The "roof" holds and we can concentrate on our main goal -- cleansing the mind, without a need to repair the roof after every light shower.

.. [DLMBSFn-V015] (DLMBS Commentary V015) Doing evil deeds is a sure way to grief and despair. As we know from modern history, the greatest evildoers of this century (Stalin, Mao, Hitler, etc.) did not have an easy life. Their were troubled personalities, seeing enemies behind every shadow. The amount of evil they created hunted them mercilessly and efficiently.

                  If we commit an evil deed (a definition of evil deed is that it is an action which harms other living beings in any way -- physical or mental) not only our consciences bothers us (or at least it should, if we are to call ourselves human beings), but it will also bring us a bad rebirth. Thus, when we see our evil deeds, we will grieve both in this life and in the next one.

.. [DLMBSFn-V016] (DLMBS Commentary V016) In direct contrast to the verse 15 (see), if we commit good deeds, helping all living beings in different ways, we will not only be happy in this life, having the satisfaction of doing good deeds, but we will also obtain a favorable rebirth. So, when we see our good deeds, we rejoice in the knowledge thereof.

.. [DLMBSFn-V017] (DLMBS Commentary V017) This pair of verses (DhP 17 and DhP 18) is closely related to the previous pair (DhP 15 and DhP 16).

                  Here again, the evildoer is tormented both here and in the next life. Not only does the very idea that he has done evil torment him, but even more grief awaits him in his next life, where he will go to the undesirable states of being -- as an animal, to the hell etc.

.. [DLMBSFn-V018] (DLMBS Commentary V018) In contrast to the previous verse (DhP 17), one, who performs good deeds is happy and delighted both in this life and after death. The idea "I have done good deeds" brings him inner satisfaction and happiness. Even more happiness then brings him his next birth - as a human being (the best of all possibilities), as a celestial being in various heavenly worlds etc.

.. [DLMBSFn-V019] (DLMBS Commentary V019) The teacher must act according to his own words. A monk, who talks nice, true words, but his acts are not in accordance with them, does not really share the blessings of monk's life. He is like a hireling, doing work for others.

                  A cowherd is poor, he usually does not have his own cows, and he just takes others' cows out to the pasture. He does not have a real profit out of his actions. In the same sense, the monk who only talks about the Buddha's teachings, but does not put them into practice himself, does not reap the fruit thereof, is just like the cowherd. Thus he neglects his own practice and as we will soon hear in coming verses, the negligence is not a good path to take.

.. [DLMBSFn-V020] (DLMBS Commentary V020) So, who can be truly called a monk, who shares the blessings of monkshood? It must be a person, who is living in accordance with the Dharma, as proclaimed by the Buddha. He must abandon all three roots of evil (lust, hatred and delusion), must have the right knowledge of the Dharma and his mind must be liberated. He must not of course be attached to anything in this world, but neither to anything in his possible future rebirths. Such a person is sharing all the blessings of monkshood, even if he does not preach the Dharma a lot.

.. [NāradaFn02-01]  (Ven. Nārada 02-01) Appamàda, literally, means non-infatuation i.e., ever-present mindfulness, watchfulness or earnestness in doing good. The ethical essence of Buddhism may be summed up by this word - appamàda. The last words of the Buddha were - appamàdena sampàdetha - strive on with diligence.

.. [NāradaFn02-02]  (Ven. Nārada 02-02) Amata - Nibbàna, the ultimate goal of Buddhists. As this positive term clearly indicates, Nibbàna is not annihilation or a state of nothingness as some are apt to believe. It is the permanent, immortal, supramundane state which cannot be expressed by mundane terms.

.. [NāradaFn02-03]  (Ven. Nārada 02-03) This should not be understood to mean that they are immortal. No being is immortal, not even Buddhas or Arahants. The idea implied herein is that the heedful, who realize Nibbàna are not reborn, and so do not die. The heedless are regarded as dead because they are not intent on doing good, and are subject to repeated births and deaths.

.. [NāradaFn02-04]  (Ven. Nārada 02-04) Knowing well that there is emancipation for the heedful, but not for the heedless.

.. [NāradaFn02-05]  (Ven. Nārada 02-05) Here Ariyas mean the pure ones like the Buddhas and Arahants. The realm of the Ariyas means the thirty-seven factors of Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiyadhamma) and the nine supramundane states. See notes on v.44 and v.115.

.. [NāradaFn02-06]  (Ven. Nārada 02-06) Here meditation includes both concentration (samatha) and contemplation or insight (vipassanà).

.. [NāradaFn02-07]  (Ven. Nārada 02-07) Yogakkhema - free from the four bonds of sense-desires (kàma), craving for existence (bhava), false views (diññhi), and ignorance (avijjà).

.. [NāradaFn02-08]  (Ven. Nārada 02-08) Nibbàna = ni + vàna, lit., departure from craving. It is a supramundane state that can be attained in this life itself. It is also explained as extinction of passions, but not a state of nothingness. It is an eternal blissful state of relief that results from the complete eradication of the passions.

                    Metaphysically Nibbàna is the extinction of suffering; psychologically it is the elimination of egoism; ethically it is the eradication of lust, hatred and ignorance.

.. [NāradaFn02-09]  (Ven. Nārada 02-09) An island situated on a higher level cannot be flooded although the surrounding low-lying land may be inundated. Such an island becomes a refuge to all. In the same way the wise man who develops insight should make an island of himself by attaining Arahantship so that he may not be drowned by the four floods of sense-desires (kàma) false beliefs (ditthi), craving for existence (bhava) and ignorance (avijjà).

.. [NāradaFn02-10]  (Ven. Nārada 02-10) The sorrowless Arahants look compassionately with their Divine Eye upon the ignorant folk, who, being subject to repeated births, are not free from sorrow.

.. [NāradaFn02-11]  (Ven. Nārada 02-11) Maghavà is synonymous with Sakka, king of the gods. The Maghamànavaka Jataka relates that in the remote past a public-spirited person who had spent his whole lifetime in welfare work with the cooperation of his friends, was born as Sakka as the result of his good actions.

.. [NāradaFn02-12]  (Ven. Nārada 02-12) Devas. lit., sporting or shining ones, are a class of beings with subtle physical bodies invisible to the naked eye. They live in the celestial planes. There are also earth-bound deities.

.. [NāradaFn02-13]  (Ven. Nārada 02-13) A fully ordained disciple of the Buddha is called a Bhikkhu. "Mendicant monk" may be suggested as the closest equivalent for "Bhikkhu". He is not a priest as he is no mediator between God and man. He has no vows for life but he is bound by his rules which he takes of his own accord. He leads a life of voluntary poverty and celibacy. If he is unable to live the Holy Life, he can discard the robe at any time.

.. [NāradaFn02-14]  (Ven. Nārada 02-14) Sa§yojana - lit., that which yokes beings to the ocean of life. There are ten kinds of fetters- namely: self-illusion (sakkàyadiññhi), doubts (vicikicchà), indulgence in (wrongful) rites and ceremonies (sãlabbataparàmàsa), sense-desires (kàmaràga), hatred (pañigha), attachment to the Realms of Form (råparàga), attachment to the Formless Realms (aråparàga), conceit (màna), restlessness (uddhacca) and ignorance (avijjà).

                    The first five, pertaining to This Shore (orambhàgiya) are regarded as small, the rest, pertaining to the Further Shore (uddhambhàgiya) as great.

                    The first three are eradicated on attaining the first Stage of Sainthood (Sotàpatti).

                    The second two are attenuated on attaining the second stage of Sainthood (Sakadàgàmi).

                    The second two are destroyed on attaining the third stage of Sainthood (Anàgàmi).

                    The last five are eradicated on attaining the fourth stage of Sainthood (Arahatta).
                    
.. [NāradaFn02-15]  (Ven. Nārada 02-15) From his spiritual heights which he has attained.

.. [BudRkFn02-01]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 02-01) (v. 21) *The Deathless (amata)*: Nibbana, so called because those who attain it are free from the cycle of repeated birth and death.

.. [BudRkFn02-02]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 02-02) (v. 22) *The Noble Ones (ariya)*: those who have reached any of the four stages of supramundane attainment leading irreversibly to Nibbana.

.. [BudRkFn02-03]  *Indra*: the ruler of the gods in ancient Indian mythology.

.. [ThaniSFn-V21] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 21) The Deathless = Unbinding (nibbana/nirvana), which gives release from the cycle of death and rebirth.

.. [ThaniSFn-V22] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 22) "The range of the noble ones": Any of the four stages of Awakening, as well as the total Unbinding to which they lead. The four stages are: (1) stream-entry, at which one abandons the first three mental fetters tying one to the round of rebirth: self-identity views, uncertainty, and grasping at habits and practices; (2) once-returning, at which passion, aversion, and delusion are further weakened; (3) non-returning, at which sensual passion and irritation are abandoned; and (4) arahantship, at which the final five fetters are abandoned: passion for form, passion for formless phenomena, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. For other references to the "range of the noble ones," see `92-93 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.07.than.html#dhp-92>`_ and `179-180 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.14.than.html#dhp-179>`_.

.. [ThaniSFn-V23] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 23) `AN 4.10 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.010.than.html>`_ lists four yokes: the yoke of sensuality, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views, and the yoke of ignorance. To gain rest from the first three yokes, one must discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, and the escape from that yoke. One will then not be obsessed with passion, delight, attraction, infatuation, thirst, fever, fascination, craving with regard to that yoke. To gain rest from the yoke of ignorance, one must discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, and the escape from the six sense media. One will then not be obsessed with not-knowing.

.. [DLMBSFn-V021] (DLMBS Commentary V021) Conscientiousness is one of the most important characteristics to be developed. Without it, we can not proceed on our path towards awakenment. If we are negligent, how can we find energy to purify our minds? 
    
                  So, the conscientiousness is the path to deathlessness. Only with it we can find our way to the final goal, Nirvana, which is the deathless state. Negligence on the other hand is the way to the repeated cycle of birth and death. 
                  
                  Conscientious people are able to reach the Nirvana, thus escaping the cycle of rebirths, whereas those, who are negligent, can not escape. They might as well be dead already.

.. [DLMBSFn-V022] (DLMBS Commentary V022) The wise people know very clearly, that the conscientiousness is the state of deathlessness (the word thus refers to the previous verse, DhP 21). Therefore, they rejoice in conscientiousness, they praise it and pay high attention to it.

                  They are delighting in the "sphere of the Noble Ones". This is of course nothing else than the Nirvana. So, again, the only way to reach this state is to make conscientious effort in this direction, applying all one's energy and striving.

.. [DLMBSFn-V023] (DLMBS Commentary V023) Continuing the line of reasoning from previous verses (DhP 21 and DhP 22), if one knows, that conscientiousness is the key to reaching of the Nirvana, one maintains a high level of it. Applying this conscientiousness to the practice of meditation, one has to persevere, constantly and with strong effort. By this, we are able to reach Nirvana, to really "touch" it here and now. Thus, we obtain the highest peace from bondage, the only true peace and freedom available.

.. [DLMBSFn-V024] (DLMBS Commentary V024) The story says that there was an heir of a rich family, named Kumbhaghosaka, once in the city of Rājagaha. His parents died in the epidemic and he alone escaped and lived in the forest for some time. When he returned, nobody recognized him. He did not want to use the family wealth (which was buried in a safe place) out of fear that people might think he found it accidentally and thus the king might confiscate it. So he found a job (waking people in the morning) and lived a poor life. 
                  
                  But the king saw him once and recognized that his voice and manners are of a man of great wealth. He then sent his maid to investigate. At the end he summoned Kumbhaghosaka to the court. There the young man told him the story and the king made him a banker and gave his daughter in marriage to him. 
                  
                  When the Buddha heard about it, he spoke this verse. 
                  
                  If one always acts properly, with energy and mindfulness, applies self-control and consideration, is always conscientious, his good repute will increase, because people will know that he is a man of honor, that they can trust him. And they will report this to the others - who will then come to see for themselves, again telling other people about this. So the good word will spread around and everybody will trust such a person.

.. [DLMBSFn-V025] (DLMBS Commentary V025) With this verse is associated the famous story of Cūḷapanthaka. There were two brothers, Mahāpantkaha and Cūḷapanthaka. Both become monks, but Cūḷapanthaka was not very clever and he was not able to learn the Buddha's Teachings. Mahāpantkaha on the other hand was very bright and he soon became an arahant. 
                  
                  The Buddha once gave a clean piece of cloth to Cūḷapantkaha and told him to rub it while repeating the words "taking on impurity". Cūḷapanthaka then did as instructed and soon the cloth became dirty. The Buddha then told him, that our mind is very similar to that piece of cloth, becoming dirty with the "dust of passion, hatred and delusion. Attaining of arahantship is not very different from cleaning the piece of cloth - we have to "wash" our minds of this dust diligently. 
                  
                  Cūḷapanthaka realized this and practiced meditation accordingly. Soon, he too became an arahant, as his elder brother. 
                  
                  The Buddha then spoke this verse, telling us that only by diligence, self-control and applying energy we can make an island in ourselves which the flood of passion, hatred and delusion will not be able to overwhelm.

.. [DLMBSFn-V026] (DLMBS Commentary V026) The story associated with this verse and the following one (DhP 27) speaks about a festival that was celebrated in the city of Sāvatthī while the Buddha was residing there. 
                  
                  Many young men were practicing some sort of religious rituals, roaming about the city, shouting and begging for money at every door in the city. 
                  
                  Buddha's lay disciples in that city warned him not to enter the city and they themselves did not leave their houses. After one week of the festival ended, the Buddha again entered Sāvatthī and then spoke these two verses (DhP 26 and 27).

.. [DLMBSFn-V027] (DLMBS Commentary V027) The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one (see DhP 26). 
                  
                  Whereas the foolish and ignorant ones indulge in negligence and sense-pleasures, as the young men did during the festival in Sāvatthī, those, who are wise, treasure the conscientiousness like a jewel. If they practice the meditation diligently, with perseverance, never becoming negligent, they will at the end definitely reach the "abundant happiness" - which is of course only another term for the Awakenment and the Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V028] (DLMBS Commentary V028) The story says, that one of the chief disciples of the Buddha, the Elder Mahākassapa was once practicing meditation, trying to find out which of the beings in the world were conscientious and which were negligent. He also tried to find who was about to be born and who was about to die. 
                  
                  The Buddha learned about this and told him not to waste his time on something like that - because such things do not lead to the Awakenment. In addition to that, such a task is possible only for a Buddha, because of the innumerable beings in the world. The Buddha the spoke this verse. 
                  
                  The negligence is of course best dispelled with the conscientiousness. When we are able to do that, we will "climb the stronghold of wisdom", we will reach the Nirvana. Then we can look at the others, who are still negligent, as somebody on the top of a mountain can watch the people on the plain below him.

.. [DLMBSFn-V029] (DLMBS Commentary V029) Once, there were two monks, who were friends. They both got a subject of meditation from the Buddha. So they went to the forest monastery to meditate. One of them was rather lazy. Because it was winter, he was warming himself by the fire the first part of the night and the other part he spent talking to other monks and novices. But the other monk was very mindful and diligent. He spent the night meditating and soon he became an arahant. 
                  
                  After the end of the retreat they went back to see the Buddha. The lazy monk actually accused the diligent one of laziness! He told Buddha, whereas he himself was first warming himself by the fire and then "not-sleeping", his friend was idling, lying down and sleeping all the time. But the Buddha of course knew the truth and he told them this verse. One friend was like a weak horse, lazy and talkative, but the other one, like a swift horse, was diligent and mindful. And he left the other friend behind - he became an arahant. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V030] (DLMBS Commentary V030) A young prince named Mahāli from the Licchavi state came to see the Buddha. He wanted to hear some teachings, so the Buddha told him the Sakkapañha Sutta (The Sutta of Sakka's questions). Mahāli wondered how was it possible, that the Buddha knew so much about Sakka, the king of the gods. Has the Buddha ever met Sakka? 

                  The Buddha confirmed that he indeed has seen Sakka and further told Mahāli the story of Sakka's previous existence. 
                  
                  He was a man named Magha. He was very righteous and did a lot of charitable work, building roads and rest houses with his friends. He took seven obligations: to support his parents, to respect elders, to be gentle of speech, to avoid backbiting, to be generous and not avaricious, to speak the truth and to restrain himself from loosing temper. He was always mindful and kept all of them. Thus in his next existence he became Sakka, the king of gods.

.. [DLMBSFn-V031] (DLMBS Commentary V031) Once there was a monk who received his subject of meditation from the Buddha. He practiced hard, but he made very little progress. So he became very depressed and frustrated. He went to see the Buddha about his problems. But on the way there he saw a big forest fire. He ran to the top of a mountain and observed. While there, he realized that just as the fire burnt up everything around, be it big or small, so the insights from the practice of meditation will burn up all the fetters, big and small. 
                  
                  The Buddha saw this from far away and appeared in front of the monk telling him that he was on the right track and to keep up the idea. The monk did accordingly and attained arahantship very soon. 
                  
                  According to Buddhist philosophy, there are ten fetters (saṃyojana). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters.

                  | The five big fetters are: 
                  | 1) personality belief (sakkāya-diṭṭhi), 
                  | 2) skeptical doubt (vicikicchā), 
                  | 3) clinging to rules and rituals (sīlabbata-paramāsa), 
                  | 4) sensuous craving (kāma-rāga), 
                  | 5) ill-will (vyāpāda).
                  | 
                  | The five small fetters are: 
                  | 1) craving for fine-material existence (rūpa-rāga), 
                  | 2) craving for immaterial existence (arūpa-rāga), 
                  | 3) conceit (māna), 
                  | 4) restlessness (uddhacca), 
                  | 5) ignorance (avijjā).

.. [DLMBSFn-V032] (DLMBS Commentary V032) Nigamavātissa was born and grew up in a small market town near Sāvatthi. He became a monk and lived a simple life. For his alms food he went to the village where his relatives lived and he kept away from all the big occasions. Even when big benefactors like Anāthapiṇḍika and king Pasenadi of Kosala gave monks alms on a grand scale, he did not attend. Some monks started to say, that he keeps only to his relatives and does not care about things. 
                  
                  The Buddha asked him about this. He replied that he goes to his village only for alms food, takes only as much as is enough, does not care if it is tasty or not. The Buddha praised him and told the other monks that they should all behave in this way. He also related the story of the king of parrots: 
                  
                  He lived in a grove of fig trees on the banks of Ganga with many subjects. When all the fruits were eaten, everybody left, except for the king, who was satisfied with little. Once Sakka, the king of gods, wanted to test him and his resolve. He assumed the form of a goose and asked him why doesn't he move away. The king said he can not leave out of the gratitude towards the tree. If he can find enough food to get by, he wouldn't go. It would be ungrateful. Sakka was impressed and revealed himself. Then he poured the Ganga water over the withered tree and it was suddenly green and full of fruit. 
                  
                  Then the Buddha said, that the king of parrots was himself in one of his previous existences and Sakka was Anuruddha, one of the Buddha's foremost disciples. He then uttered this verse (DhP 32). At the end of the discourse, Nigamavātissa became an arahant.

.. [NāradaFn03-01]  (Ven. Nārada 03-01) Citta is derived from the root cit, to think. The traditional interpretation of the term is "that which is aware of an object" (cinteti = vijānāti). Actually it is not that which thinks of an object as the term implies. If it could be said "it thinks" as one says in English "it rains", it would be more in consonance with the Buddha's teaching. From an ultimate standpoint citta may be defined as the awareness of an object, since Buddhism denies a subjective agent like a soul. According to Buddhism no distinction is made between mind and consciousness, terms which are used as equivalents for citta.

.. [NāradaFn03-02]  (Ven. Nārada 03-02) Pahātave is used in the sense of pahātabba = should be shunned.

.. [NāradaFn03-03]  (Ven. Nārada 03-03) Because no two thought moments arise at a particular time.

.. [NāradaFn03-04]  (Ven. Nārada 03-04) The imperceptible mind is immaterial and colourless.

.. [NāradaFn03-05]  (Ven. Nārada 03-05) Guhāsayaṃ - i.e., the seat of consciousness. It is clear that the Buddha has not definitely assigned a specific basis for consciousness as He had done with the other senses. It was the cardiac theory (the theory that the heart is the seat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Paññhāna, the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such indirect terms as yaṃ rūpaṃ nissāya, dependent on that material thing. What the material thing was the Buddha did not positively assert. According to the views of commentators like the Venerables Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha the seat of consciousness is the heart (hadayavatthu).

                    One wonders whether one is justified in presenting the cardiac theory as Buddhistic when the Buddha Himself neither rejected nor accepted this popular theory.

.. [NāradaFn03-06]  (Ven. Nārada 03-06) Namely: spiritual wisdom or insight.

.. [NāradaFn03-07]  (Ven. Nārada 03-07) The deeds of an Arahant, a perfect Saint, are neither good nor bad because he has gone beyond both good and evil. This does not mean that he is passive. He is active but his activity is selfless and is directed to help others to tread the path he has trod himself. His deeds, ordinarily accepted as good, lack creative power as regards himself in producing Kammic effects. He is not however exempt from the effects of his past actions. He accumulates no fresh kammic activities. Whatever actions he does, as an Arahant, are termed "inoperative" (kiriya), and are not regarded as Kamma. They are ethically ineffective. Understanding things as they truly are, he has finally shattered the cosmic chain of cause and effect.

.. [NāradaFn03-08]  (Ven. Nārada 03-08) It should not erroneously be understood that Arahants do not sleep. Whether asleep or awake they are regarded as sleepless or vigilant ones, since the five stimulating virtues - namely confidence (saddhā), energy (viriya), mindfulness (sati), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (paññā) are ever present in them.

.. [NāradaFn03-09]  (Ven. Nārada 03-09) The passions.

.. [NāradaFn03-10]  (Ven. Nārada 03-10) By conquest is here meant the newly developed insight (vipassanā).

.. [NāradaFn03-11]  (Ven. Nārada 03-11) For the Jhānas (absorptions or ecstasies) which the aspirant has developed. The Jhānas are highly developed mental states obtained by intensified concentration.

.. [NāradaFn03-12]  (Ven. Nārada 03-12) Kaëingaraṃ, a rotten log which cannot be used for any purpose.

.. [NāradaFn03-13]  (Ven. Nārada 03-13) That is, the mind directed towards the ten kinds of evil - namely: 1. killing, 2. stealing, 3. sexual misconduct, 4. lying, 5. slandering, 6. harsh speech, 7. vain talk, 8. covetousness, 9. ill-will, and 10. false belief.

.. [NāradaFn03-14]  (Ven. Nārada 03-14) That is the mind directed towards the ten kinds of meritorious deeds (kusala) - namely: 1. generosity, 2. morality, 3. meditation, 4. reverence, 5. service, 6. transference of merit, 7. rejoicing in others' merit, 8. hearing the doctrine, 9. expounding the doctrine, and 10. straightening one's right views.

.. [BudRkFn-v39]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 39) The arahant is said to be beyond both merit and demerit because, as he has abandoned all defilements, he can no longer perform evil actions; and as he has no more attachment, his virtuous actions no longer bear kammic fruit.

.. [ThaniSFn-V37] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 37) "Lying in a cave": According to the Dhp Commentary (hereafter referred to as DhpA), "cave" here means the physical heart, as well as the four great properties — earth (solidity), water (liquidity), fire (heat), and wind (motion) — that make up the body. `Sn 4.2 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.4.02.than.html>`__ also compares the body to a cave.

.. [ThaniSFn-V39] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 39) According to DhpA, "unsoddened mind" means one into which the rain of passion doesn't penetrate (see `13 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.01.than.html#dhp-13>`__ and `14 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.01.than.html#dhp-14>`__ ); "unassaulted awareness" means a mind not assaulted by anger. "Beyond merit & evil": The arahant is beyond merit and evil in that he/she has none of the mental defilements — passion, aversion, or delusion — that would lead to evil actions, and none of the attachments that would cause his/her actions to bear kammic fruit of any sort, good or bad.

.. [ThaniSFn-V40] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 40) "Without settling there, without laying claim": two meanings of the word anivesano.

.. [ThaniSFn-V42] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 42) `AN 7.60 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.060.than.html>`__ illustrates this point with seven ways that a person harms him/herself when angry, bringing on results that an enemy would wish: He/she becomes ugly, sleeps badly, mistakes profit for loss and loss for profit, loses wealth, loses his/her reputation, loses friends, and acts in such a way that — after death — he/she reappears in a bad rebirth.

.. [DLMBSFn-V033] (DLMBS Commentary V033) Once the Buddha was staying on Cālika mountain. One of the monks, Meghiya Thera was attending upon him. This Thera saw a nice mango grove and asked the Buddha for permission to go there for meditation. But there were no other monks at that time and the Buddha needed an attendance. So he told Meghiya to wait for arrival of somebody else and then he could go. 

                  But Meghiya wanted to go really badly, so he asked the Buddha again and again, until he got his permission. He went to the grove and started to meditate, only to find out that his mind was wandering. He stayed there the whole day, but made no progress. 
                  
                  In the evening he reported to the Buddha, how he was all the time assailed by thoughts associated with senses, ill will and cruelty. The Buddha told him the verses 33 and 34 and Meghiya attained Sotāpatti, the first stage on the way to awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V034] (DLMBS Commentary V034) The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one (DhP 33). Our mind is indeed wavering, writhing and difficult to restrain, like a snake or a young branch. An arrow maker making an arrow has to straighten it first; otherwise it would be a worthless arrow. In the same way, we have to straighten the mind; otherwise we cannot hit the goal with it. 
                  
                  When we want to leave Mara's realm, the world, the mind trembles and flickers just like a fish thrown on a dry ground, suddenly without its familiar surroundings, unable to relate to this new situation.

.. [DLMBSFn-V035] (DLMBS Commentary V035) Sixty monks received their meditation subjects from the Buddha and they went to the village of Mātika. There the mother of the village headman, called Mātikamātā, built a monastery for them and gave them alms food regularly. So they decided to spend the Rain Retreat there. She asked them to teach her some Dharma and they taught her the 32 body parts and awareness of the body's decay. She practiced diligently and attained the third (last but one) stage of awakenment. She also attained some supernormal powers; she was able to read other people's minds. She used this power and saw that the sixty monks have not so far attained anything. She saw, that they all had potential for arahantship, but they needed proper food. So she gave them alms food and soon they all became arahants. 
                  
                  At the end of the retreat they went back to the Buddha and reported what happened. A certain monk decided to go to the same village. Mātikamātā personally came to the monastery and gave him alms food. He asked her about her supernormal powers, but she evaded this subject. He got scared that she will see his impure mind and left the village. 
                  
                  He told the Buddha about his fears, but the Buddha sent him back, telling him to control his mind under all circumstances. So the monk went back, thinking only about his meditation subject. Mātikamātā made sure that he had enough alms food and the monk too attained arahantship soon.

.. [DLMBSFn-V036] (DLMBS Commentary V036) Once in the city of Sāvatthi, there lived a son of a banker. He asked a monk who came to his house for alms food, how to be liberated from the ills of life. The monk instructed him to divide his property into three parts. One he was to do business with, one to support his family, one for charity. The man did so and then asked what to do next. He was instructed to take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha and to observe five precepts. But the man was still not satisfied. So the monk told him to renounce the world and to become a monk too. 
                  
                  As a monk he was taught Dharma by one teacher and Vinaya by another. Thus he felt that there was too much to learn, the rules were too strict and there was no freedom. He wanted to return to lay life. He began to have doubts, was discontent and unhappy, neglected his meditation. The Buddha told him that if he only could control his mind, he had nothing else to control. Then he told him this verse. The monk attained arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V037] (DLMBS Commentary V037) Saṅgharakkhita Thera was from the city of Sāvatthi. His sister gave birth to a son. People called him "The nephew Saṅgharakkhita". He also became a monk. 
                  
                  Once he was offered two sets of robes. He wanted to give one set to his uncle. So at the end of the retreat he went to see him, but his uncle did not want a robe, saying he had enough. The young man felt bad, thinking the uncle does not want to share with him. So he decided to leave the Order. 
                  
                  His mind began to wander and a train of thoughts appeared. When he became a layman he would sell his robes and buy a goat. The goat would breed quickly and soon he would have enough money to marry. His wife would give birth to a son. He would take his wife and son in a cart to see the uncle. On the way he would say he could carry the child. She would tell him to drive that she could carry the baby. But he will insist and grab the child. The child would fall down and the wheel would pass over him. He would get furious and hit his wife with the goading stick. 
                  
                  At that time he was fanning the Thera and absentmindedly hit him with the fan. His uncle said: "You were unable to beat your wife, why hit an old monk?" The young man was embarrassed and frightened of his uncle, so he fled. The monks chased him and took him to see the Buddha. He told him the verse and said that the mind has ability to think of objects far away and that one should strive for liberation. The young monk attained the first stage of awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V038] (DLMBS Commentary V038) A certain man from Sāvatthi was once looking for his ox lost in the forest. He got hungry so he went to a village monastery, where the monks gave him the remains of the morning meal. While eating, he realized that he was working hard every day, but did not even have enough food. What if he became a monk? So he asked the monks to grant him an ordination. As a monk he had plenty of food, soon he was quite fat. 
                  
                  After some time he grew tired of going for alms and so he decided to become a layman again. Later he again changed his mind, thinking the life too strenuous and became a monk. In this way he left the Order and came back six times. 
                  
                  While he was going back and forth, his wife became pregnant. Once he entered their bedroom when she was asleep. She was almost naked, snoring loudly, saliva trickling down the mouth. This and her bloated stomach made her look like a corpse. He was able to perceive impermanence and unpleasantness of the body. He was thinking that he was a monk for several times and only because of this woman he was not able to stay. So he left home for seventh time, repeating as he went the words "impermanence" and "suffering" and on the way to the monastery he attained the first stage of awakenment. But the monks did not want to permit him into the Order, joking: "You have been shaving your head so often, that it looks like a whetting stone." He asked once more and the monks granted him the ordination one last time. Within few days he attained arahantship. 
                  
                  The monks were surprised to see him staying so long, so they asked what happened. The man said he had no attachments any more, so why would he leave. But they did not believe him and asked the Buddha, who said it was the truth. The man was an arahant now, who discarded both the ideas of good and evil.

.. [DLMBSFn-V039] (DLMBS Commentary V039) The story for this verse is identical with the previous one (DhP 38). 
                  
                  If the mind is unsteady, the confidence in the Teaching wavering and one is not really resolved to do anything about it, the wisdom will not grow. But with a strong conscientiousness and watchfulness, the mind can get rid of the passions and unsteadiness. Then one is able to abandon all the ideas of good and evil and become free, just like the man from our story did.

.. [DLMBSFn-V040] (DLMBS Commentary V040) Our body is like a jar, very fragile. And our mind should be like a fortified city, guarded everywhere. The story for this verse says: 
                  
                  Five hundred monks from Sāvatthi received the meditation subjects and went far away to a large grove. The guardian spirits of the trees there saw that the monks came and decided that it would be impolite to stay in the trees. So they descended, thinking the monks will only stay one night. But they decided to spend the Rain retreat there. The spirits did not want to live on the ground so long, so they scared the monks by terrible sounds and ghostly images. 
                  
                  The monks ran away and told the Buddha what happened. He told them that they did not have any weapon, so they must be armed with loving kindness (Mettā). He then taught them the Mettā sutta. He further instructed them to recite the poem from the outskirts of the forest and enter the monastery still reciting. The monks did accordingly. 
                  
                  The spirits received their loving kindness, welcomed them and did them no harm. The monks meditated on the 32 parts of the body and realized its impermanence. The Buddha saw it from away, appeared in front of them, saying, yes, the body is like a jar. He also told them this verse (DhP 40). All five hundred monks became arahants.

.. [DLMBSFn-V041] (DLMBS Commentary V041) There was a monk called Thera Tissa. He diligently meditated and had many students, but then he was afflicted with a disease. Small boils appeared all over his body, and then big sores developed from them. Later sores burst, emitting pus and blood; his robes became dirty and stinky. The monks called him Pūtigatatissa, Tissa with stinking body. They kept away from him, even his pupils abandoned him, and nobody would go near him. 
                  
                  The Buddha saw his sorrowful state, saw that he would soon die, but that he could also attain arahantship very quickly. So the Buddha went to the fire-shed close to the place, where the Thera was living. He boiled some water, went to the monk's room and started to carry him out. Other monks also gathered and helped him to carry the sick Thera out. They brought him to the fire-shed, bathed him and washed his robes. 
                  
                  After taking the bath, the monk became fresh in body and mind, he developed one-pointedness and concentration. The Buddha then related this verse (DhP 41) and Thera Tissa became an arahant immediately. Soon after that he passed away.

.. [DLMBSFn-V042] (DLMBS Commentary V042) In the country of Kosala there once lived a herdsman named Nanda. He looked after the cows of the famous benefactor Anāthapiṇḍika. Sometimes he would go to Anāthapiṇḍika's house and listen to the Buddha's discourses. Once Nanda asked the Buddha to come to his house for alms food. The Buddha replied that he would come, but the time is not yet right and Nanda should wait. 
                  
                  After some time the Buddha was traveling and went off his usual route to see Nanda, because he knew that the time for him to do so was ripe. Nanda received him, served the Buddha and monks milk and milk products and all kinds of food. This lasted for seven days. On the last day after hearing the Buddha's discourse, Nanda attained the first stage of awakenment. 
                  
                  When the Buddha was leaving, Nanda carried his bowl for him some distance and then turned back home. Suddenly a hunter, his old enemy, shot him. The monks saw Nanda laying dead on the road. They told the Buddha that because of them, because they came to his house and he was accompanying them, Nanda died. But the Buddha said that there was no escape from death for him. And he told the monks this verse (DhP 42).

.. [DLMBSFn-V043] (DLMBS Commentary V043) In the city of Soreyya, there once lived a son of rich man. His name was also Soreyya. Once he was going with friend in a luxurious carriage to take a bath. They saw Mahākaccāyana Thera adjusting his robe before he entered Soreyya to get his alms food. Soreyya said: "I wish the monk was my wife, or my wife had a complexion like he has!" With that he changed to a woman. He was ashamed and ran away and began to travel to the city of Taxila. His friend was looking for him everywhere, but did not find any trace. 
                  
                  Soreyya (now woman) offered her ring to some people, going to Taxila, and they took her with them in a carriage. When they got there, the people told one young rich man about the beautiful girl who came with them to the city. The man married her. She gave birth to two sons, but also had two sons from the previous marriage as a man. 
                  
                  Once a merchant from Soreyya came to Taxila to do some business. She sent for him, because she recognized an old friend in him. But of course, he did not know who she was. She asked many questions about her old family and other friends. The man related to her the story about the disappeared man. She revealed her identity and told him all what happened. The man advised her to ask pardon from the Thera. 
                  
                  Mahākaccāyana was invited to her house and she offered him alms food. The lady explained what happened and asked for pardon. The Thera said: "Get up, I forgive you." With that she became a man again. 
                  
                  But he kept thinking how during a single life his body could undergo two changes of sex and have children both as a man and as a woman. He felt these things were very repulsive and decided to leave the lay life. 
                  
                  People often asked him if he loved more the two sons he had as a man or the two sons he had as a woman. He always answered that the sons whom he (as a woman) personally delivered were closer to him. People asked him this question so often that he became ashamed and annoyed. He stayed by himself, diligently meditating on the decay of the body. Soon he attained arahantship. When people again asked him the same question, he said he had no affection for any one in particular. 
                  
                  Others thought he does not speak the truth, so they asked the Buddha about it. But he told them that Soreyya does not lie. Now he is an arahant, his well directed mind brought him a well being which neither the father nor the mother could bestow on him.

.. [NāradaFn04-01]  (Ven. Nārada 04-01) Vijessati = attano ñāṇena vijānissati - who will know by one's own wisdom? (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn04-02]  (Ven. Nārada 04-02)  That is one who will understand oneself as one really is.

.. [NāradaFn04-03]  (Ven. Nārada 04-03)  By the realm of Yama are meant the four woeful states - namely hell, the animal kingdom, the Peta Realm, and the Asura Realm. Hell is not permanent according to Buddhism. It is a state of misery as are the other planes where beings suffer for their past evil actions.

.. [NāradaFn04-04]  (Ven. Nārada 04-04)  Namely: the human plane and the six celestial planes. These seven are regarded as blissful states (sugati).

.. [NāradaFn04-05]  (Ven. Nārada 04-05)  Devas, lit., sporting or shining ones. They are also a class of beings who enjoy themselves, experiencing the effects of their past good actions. They too are subject to death.

.. [NāradaFn04-06]  (Ven. Nārada 04-06)  Dhammapada. The Commentary states that this term is applied to the thirty-seven Factors of Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiyadhamma). They are:-

                    I.The four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipaññhāna) - namely: 1. contemplation of the body (kāyānupassanā), 2. contemplation of the feelings (vedanānupassanā), 3. contemplation of thoughts (cittānupassanā), and 4. contemplation of phenomena (dhammānupassanā).

                    II.The four Supreme Efforts (Sammappadāna) - namely: 1. the effort to prevent evil that has not arisen, 2. the effort to discard evil that has already arisen, 3. the effort to cultivate unarisen good, and 4. the effort to promote good that has already arisen.

                    III.The four Means of Accomplishment (iddhipāda) - namely: will (chanda), energy (viriya), thought (citta), and wisdom (vimaṃsā).

                    IV.The five faculties (Indriya) - namely: confidence (saddhā), energy (viriya), mindfulness (sati), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (paññā).

                    V.The five Forces (Bala), having the same names as the Indriyas.

                    VI.The seven Constituents of Enlightenment (Bojjhaṅga) - namely: mindfulness (sati), investigation of the Truth (Dhammavicaya), energy (viriya), joy (pīti), serenity (passaddhi), concentration (samādhi), and equanimity (upekkhā).

                    VII.The Eightfold Path (Aññhaṅgikamagga) - namely: right views (sammā diññhi), right thoughts (sammā saṅkappa), right speech (sammā vācā), right actions (sammā kammanta), right livelihood (sammā ājīva), right endeavour (sammā vāyāma), right mindfulness (sammā sati) and right concentration (sammā samādhi).

.. [NāradaFn04-07]  (Ven. Nārada 04-07)  The term sekha, lit., one who is still under going training, is applied to a disciple who has attained the first stage of Sainthood (Sotāpatti = Stream-winner) until he attains the final Arahatta fruit stage. When he totally eradicates all fetters (saṃyojana) and attains the fruit stage of an Arahant, he is called an Asekha, as he has perfected his training. It is an asekha disciple who understands him self and the whole world as they really are. There is no graceful English equivalent for this difficult Pali term. "Adept" (= one who has attained) may be suggested as the closest rendering.

.. [NāradaFn04-08]  (Ven. Nārada 04-08)  Owing to its fleeting nature.

.. [NāradaFn04-09]  (Ven. Nārada 04-09)  Because there is nothing substantial in this body.

.. [NāradaFn04-10]  (Ven. Nārada 04-10)  Namely life's sorrow, born of passions. An Arahant destroys all passions by his wisdom and attains Nibbāna where there is no death.

.. [NāradaFn04-11]  (Ven. Nārada 04-11)  Antaka, lit., Ender, which means death.

.. [NāradaFn04-12]  (Ven. Nārada 04-12)  Seeking alms, without inconveniencing any.

.. [NāradaFn04-13]  (Ven. Nārada 04-13)  A kind of shrub from which a fragrant powder is obtained.

.. [NāradaFn04-14]  (Ven. Nārada 04-14)  The personification of evil. See note on vs. 8.

.. [NāradaFn04-15]  (Ven. Nārada 04-15)  Nobody is condemned in Buddhism, for greatness is latent even in the seemingly lowliest just as lotuses spring from muddy ponds.

.. [BudRkFn-v45]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 45) The Striver-on-the-Path (sekha): one who has achieved any of the first three stages of supramundane attainment: a stream-enterer, once-returner, or non-returner.

.. [BudRkFn-v49]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 49) The "sage in the village" is the Buddhist monk who receives his food by going silently from door to door with his alms bowls, accepting whatever is offered.

.. [BudRkFn-v54]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 54) Tagara: a fragrant powder obtained from a particular kind of shrub.

.. [ThaniSFn-V44-45] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 44-45) "Dhamma-saying": This is a translation for the term dhammapada. To ferret out the well-taught Dhamma-saying means to select the appropriate maxim to apply to a particular situation, in the same way that a flower-arranger chooses the right flower, from a heap of available flowers (see 53), to fit into a particular spot in the arrangement. "The learner-on-the-path": A person who has attained any of the first three of the four stages of Awakening (see note 22).

.. [ThaniSFn-V48] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 48) According to DhpA, the End-maker is death. According to another ancient commentary, the End-maker is Mara.

.. [ThaniSFn-V53] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 53) The last line of the Pali here can be read in two ways, either "even so, many a skillful thing should be done by one born & mortal" or "even so, many a skillful thing should be done with what's born & mortal." The first reading takes the phrase jatena maccena, born & mortal, as being analogous to the flower-arranger implicit in the image. The second takes it as analogous to the heap of flowers explicitly mentioned. In this sense, "what's born & is mortal" would stand for one's body, wealth, and talents.

.. [ThaniSFn-V54-56] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 54-56) Tagara = a shrub that, in powdered form, is used as a perfume. AN 3.78 explains the how the scent of a virtuous person goes against the wind and wafts to the devas, by saying that those human and celestial beings who know of the good character of a virtuous person will broadcast one's good name in all directions.

.. [ThaniSFn-V57] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 57) "Right knowing": the knowledge of full Awakening.

.. [VaradoFn04-1]  (Ven. Varado 04-1) A sekha is a noble disciple who has achieved stream-entry but not arahantship. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V044] (DLMBS Commentary V044) A group of monks accompanied the Buddha to a certain village and then they all returned to the monastery. The monks started to talk about the trip. They paid close attention to the condition of the land: whether it was level or hilly, whether the soil was clayey or sandy etc. 

                  The Buddha visited them and when overheard the topic of their discussion, he told them to better concentrate on their own bodies. He said, that the earth is external and that they should strive to examine their own bodies and understand what they really are. 
                  
                  He then added that by understanding one's own body we are also able to understand the whole world. We will be able to realize the Dharma, just as a skilful garland-maker makes the garlands. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V045] (DLMBS Commentary V045) The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one (DhP 44). 
                  
                  The disciple of the Buddha is able to investigate this world. By understanding and realizing the Dharma we can also fully understand the whole world with all its beings, because the Dharma is after all concerned just with this world, its conditions and our position in this world. So, just as a skilful garland-maker can pick flowers easily, we, as Buddha's followers, can investigate the Dharma and with it the whole world. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V046] (DLMBS Commentary V046) A certain monk obtained his meditation subject from the Buddha. He went to the forest and practiced diligently. But for some reason he made very little progress and was not happy. He set out on a journey back to tell the Buddha about his difficulties and to obtain another meditation subject. 
                  
                  But on the way he saw a mirage. He realized, that a mirage is only an illusion of water and that also his body is an illusion as well. He fixed his mind on this understanding and continued with his meditation. 
                  
                  Later he went for a bath to a river and there he saw the foam, how it was insubstantial and breaking up quickly. Thus he further realized the impermanent nature of the body. 
                  
                  The Buddha then sent him his image and told him to keep up the meditation this way. The monk attained the arahantship and escaped the King of Death forever. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V047] (DLMBS Commentary V047) By "flowers" are meant the pleasures of the senses here. One, who only keeps "gathering flowers", or in other words chase after the sense-pleasures, will be carried away by death, as the army of the king of Kosala in this story. 
                  
                  King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the clan of the Sākyans (Buddha's own relatives) to give him one of their daughters as a wife. But they sent him a daughter of a slave woman by king Mahānāma. Pasenadi did not know that and married her. She gave birth to a son, who was named Vidudabha. 
                  
                  Later Vidudabha found out, that his mother was a daughter of a slave and became very angry with the Sākyans. When he became the king, he declared war on them and killed almost all of the Sākyan clan. On the way back, he and his army encamped on the bank of a river. That night, heavy rain fell; the river swelled and carried Vidudabha and his army to the ocean. 
                  
                  When Buddha heard what happened, he uttered this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V048] (DLMBS Commentary V048) In the city of Sāvatthi there lived a woman named Pati Pujikā Kumāri. She was very generous and virtuous. She gave alms to everyone in need and generally helped everybody. 
                  
                  She also remembered her one previous life. She used to be one of the wives of the God 
                  
                  Mālabhāri in the Tāvatimsa heaven. So she would often pray that she might be born there again in her next life. 
                  
                  One day she fell ill and passed away. And she was really reborn in the Tāvatimsa heaven. The other gods did not even miss her, because one hundred years in the human world is just one day in Tāvatimsa. So they asked her, where had she been the whole morning. She then told them the whole story. 
                  
                  When the Buddha heard, that Pati Pujikā died, he explained that the life was very brief. Before the beings could be satisfied in the pleasures of the senses, they would be overpowered by death. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V049] (DLMBS Commentary V049) This verse talks about the practice of alms-rounds. The monks are supposed to obtain alms food from the people, going house from house and taking something here, something there, especially from those, who have a lot. Just like a bee takes the juice from the flower but does no harm to it, so the monks should get the food from the villagers, making no harm to them by taking too much from one family or from the poor families. 
                  
                  The following story is associated with this verse. 
                  
                  In one village there lived a very rich but very miserly couple. One day they made some pancakes, but because they did not want to share them with others, they made them secretly. 
                  
                  The Buddha saw this and sent one of his chief disciples, Moggallāna to their house. He arrived there and stood by the door. They tried to make a very small pancake and give it to him. But no matter how they tried, a small amount of dough would fill in the whole pan. Then they tried to offer him one of their own pancakes, but they were unable to separate them. So they gave him the whole basket with all their pancakes. 
                  
                  Moggallāna invited them to the monastery to see the Buddha. They offered the pancakes to the Buddha and the monks. The Buddha delivered a discourse on charity and both the husband and wife attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V050] (DLMBS Commentary V050) In Sāvatthi once lived a lady who was a disciple of the ascetic Pāthika. All her friends and neighbors were the disciples of the Buddha and she often wanted to go to the monastery herself, to hear the Buddha's teachings. But Pāthika always prevented her from going there. 
                  
                  So she invited the Buddha to her house for almsgiving instead. He came together with many monks and after the meal he delivered a teaching. She was very impressed and happy and exclaimed, "Well said!" 
                  
                  Pāthika heard this from the next room and became very angry. He left the house, cursing the woman and the Buddha. 
                  
                  The lady was very embarrassed by this. But the Buddha advised her not to be concerned about others' curses, but to be only mindful of her own good and bad deeds. At the end she attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V051] (DLMBS Commentary V051) A certain Buddha's disciple named Chattapāni has attained the second stage of Awakenment. Once, while he was listening to the Buddha's discourse, the king Pasenadi came to the monastery. Chattapāni did not get up, because by paying homage to the king he would disrespect the Buddha. The king was very unhappy about that, thinking that Chattapāni offended him. But the Buddha explained to the king what Chattapāni meant. The king was impressed and asked Chattapāni to teach Dharma to his queens. But he refused, saying that monks should teach Dharma, not mere lay disciples. 
                  
                  The Buddha then assigned Ānanda to teach them. After some time the Buddha asked, how much progress did the queens make. Ānanda replied, that the queen Mallikā was learning very quickly and seriously, the queen Vāsabha Khattiyā was not paying attention and therefore made no progress. 
                  
                  The Buddha replied by this verse, saying that only those, who learn diligently and then practice what they learned, can benefit from the Dharma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V052] (DLMBS Commentary V052) The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one. 
                  
                  One who speaks well, who often admonishes others, but does not act according to one’s own speech speaks in vain. His words are just as a beautiful flower that does not smell. Only when one acts as well as one speak, one's speech can be considered well said, like a nice flower that also smells nicely.

.. [DLMBSFn-V053] (DLMBS Commentary V053) The traditional commentary for this verse contains the famous story of the chief Buddha's benefactress Visākhā. 
                  
                  She married Punnavaddhana, the son of Migāra, a rich man who lived in the city of Sāvatthi. Once, when her father-in-law was eating his lunch, a monk came to their house on his alms-round. Migāra ignored him completely. Visākhā told the monk: "Sorry, venerable sir, my father-in-law only eats stale food". Migāra became very angry with her. She explained, that he was only reaping rewards of his good deeds from previous lives, not creating any merit in this life. Therefore she spoke about "stale food". 
                  
                  Migāra understood and allowed her to invite the Buddha with the monks for the alms-food. Migāra listened to Buddha's discourse from behind a curtain (because he was a lay disciple of some ascetic teacher and he did not want Migāra to show himself in front of the Buddha). After hearing Buddha's speech, Migāra attained the first stage of Awakenment. He was very grateful to Visākhā and declared that she would be like a mother to him. 
                  
                  Once she went to the monastery and carried her gem-entrusted cloak with her. She gave it to her maid to carry and she forgot it in the monastery. Visākhā then wanted to donate the cloak to the monks but they would not accept. So Visākhā tried to sell the cloak and donate the money for the use of the Sangha. But the cloak was so expensive that nobody could afford to buy it. Visākhā then bought it back herself. With the money she built a monastery for the Sangha. 
                  
                  Visākhā was very happy - all her desires were fulfilled. The Buddha explained that she was strongly inclined to do good deeds, had done much good in the past and will do a lot of good deeds in the future - just as one can do many garlands from the heap of flowers.

.. [DLMBSFn-V054] (DLMBS Commentary V054) Venerable Ānanda was once sitting in meditation and he was pondering the problem of scent. All the known scents - perfumes, flowers, roots etc. go only with the wind. No scent can go against the wind. Is there any scent at all that can go against the wind? 
                  
                  He asked the Buddha about it. The Buddha said that there exists such thing. A person, who takes refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, observes the moral precepts and is generous, is really worthy of praise. The "scent", or the reputation, of such a person spreads far and wide, with the wind and against it. Such a person is famous everywhere and people praise him.

.. [DLMBSFn-V055] (DLMBS Commentary V055) tagaraṃ: tagara-, N.n: the incense obtained from a kind of shrub (in Latin: Tabernaemontana coronaria). Nom.Sg. = tagaraṃ.

                  The story for this verse is identical with that for the previous verse (DhP 54). 
                  
                  The "scent" or reputation of virtue is the highest. All the other natural scents cannot compete with it, because they can be smelt only for a short time and only in a short distance. But the smell of virtue can be felt for a long period of time and in all directions. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V056] (DLMBS Commentary V056) One of the Buddha's chief disciples, Venerable Kassapa, went to the city of Rājagaha for alms food. He wanted to give some poor man opportunity to give him food and thus obtain merit. 
                  
                  Sakka, the king of the gods saw this, he assumed the form of an old poor weaver and together with his wife Sujātā came to Rājagaha. Venerable Kassapa stood at their door and Sakka filled his bowl with delicious rice and curry. Kassapa thought, that this cannot be a poor man - how could such a person afford so delicious food? Kassapa then realized that this man and his wife are actually Sakka and Sujātā. 
                  
                  They admitted this fact and told Kassapa that they were too very poor - they did not have enough opportunity to give alms and thus did not accumulate any merit. 
                  
                  Monks asked the Buddha how Sakka knew Kassapa was such a virtuous person that any alms given to him reap great meritorious reward. The Buddha answered by this verse, telling them that the fame of Kassapa's virtue reached even amongst the gods.

.. [DLMBSFn-V057] (DLMBS Commentary V057) A monk named Godhika was practicing meditation diligently. But whenever he made some progress in his meditation, he became seriously ill. It impaired effectiveness of his meditation, but he nevertheless continued to practice. 
                  
                  At the end he decided to strive for the arahantship even if he were to die. So he concentrated on physical pain as his meditation object and cut his throat (this can nor be considered a suicide, because he was very close to arahantship anyway and he already eradicated all cravings). Thus, concentrating on the pain, he attained his goal and then passed away. 
                  
                  Mara tried to find where Godhika was reborn but he could not find him anywhere. So he went and asked the Buddha about Godhika. The Buddha told him, that Godhika became an arahant and Mara could never be able to find him again. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V058] (DLMBS Commentary V058) In the city of Sāvatthi, there lived two friends, Sirigutta and Garahadinna. Sirigutta was a student of the Buddha and Garahadinna followed Nigantha's teaching. Garahadinna always instigated his friend to become a Nigantha's follower too. He would boast that his teachers know all the past, present and future. 
                  
                  So Sirigutta once invited his friend's teachers to his house. He prepared a deep hole, filled it with dirt and put the seats on ropes on top of this trench. Niganthas came and when they sat down, the ropes broke and Niganthas fell into the pit. Sirigutta asked them how come they claim to know the future but they did not know what would happen to them. They did not know what to say and fled in terror. 
                  
                  Garahadinna wanted to take revenge on his friend's teacher too, so he invited the Buddha and some monks to his house for alms food. He dug a hole, filled it with burning coal, and covered with mats. But when the Buddha entered and sat down, the coal disappeared and instead of it big lotus flowers appeared. 
                  
                  Garahadinna was very alarmed. Then he realized that as he did not expect the Buddha to survive this test, he did not prepare any food. But when he entered the kitchen, he found out that a lot of food appeared there as if from nowhere. So he served the food to the Buddha and the monks. 
                  
                  After the lunch, the Buddha taught the two friends Dharma in a gradual manner. At the end they both attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V059] (DLMBS Commentary V059) The story to this verse is identical to the previous one. 
                  
                  Just as a lotus can grow in a dirty place, but does not become stained by it, so a true disciple of the Buddha lives in this world, but is not dirtied by it in any way.

.. [NāradaFn05-01]  (Ven. Nārada 05-01) Lit., wandering again and again. It is the ocean of life or existence. Saṃsāra is defined as the unbroken flow of the stream of aggregates, elements, and sense-faculties. Saṃsāra is also explained as the "continued flow of the stream of being from life to life, from existence to existence".

.. [NāradaFn05-02]  (Ven. Nārada 05-02) Sahāyatā, According to the Commentary this term connotes higher morality, insight, Paths and Fruits of Sainthood. No such virtues are found in the foolish.

.. [NāradaFn05-03]  (Ven. Nārada 05-03) Out of compassion, to work for their betterment one may associate with the foolish but not be contaminated by them.

.. [NāradaFn05-04]  (Ven. Nārada 05-04) Madhu vā - in most texts

.. [NāradaFn05-05]  (Ven. Nārada 05-05) Literally month after month, with a kusa grass blade, a fool may eat his food.

.. [NāradaFn05-06]  (Ven. Nārada 05-06) Saṅkhatadhammānaṃ, "who have well weighed the Law", Max Muller and Burlingame. "Who well have taken things into account", Mrs. Rhys Davids. "Who have studied the Dhamma noble", Woodward. The commentarial explanation is: "The Ariyas who have realized the four Noble Truths".

                    The prolonged, so-called meritorious fasting of alien ascetics who have not destroyed the passions, is not worth the sixteenth part of a solitary day's fasting of an Ariya who has realized the four noble Truths.

.. [NāradaFn05-07]  (Ven. Nārada 05-07) That is, his wisdom.

.. [NāradaFn05-08]  (Ven. Nārada 05-08) Viveka, separation or detachment, is threefold, namely: bodily separation from the crowd (kāyaviveka), mental separation from passions (cittaviveka), and complete separation from all conditioned things which is Nibbāna (upadhiviveka).

.. [ThaniSFn-V71] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 71) "Doesn't — like ready milk — come out right away": All Pali recensions of this verse give the verb muccati — "to come out" or "to be released" — whereas DhpA agrees with the Sanskrit recensions in reading the verb as if it were mucchati/murchati, "to curdle." The former reading makes more sense, both in terms of the image of the poem — which contrasts coming out with staying hidden — and with the plain fact that fresh milk doesn't curdle right away. The Chinese translation of Dhp supports this reading, as do two of three scholarly editions of the Patna Dhp.

.. [DLMBSFn-V060] (DLMBS Commentary V060) King Pasenadi of Kosala once saw a beautiful woman in the city. He instantly fell in love with her. He found out that she was already married and so he gave her husband a job in the palace. Then the king sent the young man on an impossible mission. He told him to collect some lotus flowers and red earth from the underground world and to return to the city the same day. He thought of course that the man will never complete the task and so will never dare to come back. Thus the king could take the wife to himself. 

                  The young man set out on his mission. On the way he shared his food with some traveler. Then he threw the rest of the food to the river and called the guardian spirits, telling them that he shares with them his merit obtained from sharing the food with others. The guardian spirit of the river then brought him the flowers and earth from the underworld. 
                  
                  The young man returned to the city only to find the gates closed. The king had the city gates closed early in fear that the man will complete the task in time. So he put the flowers and earth on the ground, declared loudly that his mission is complete and went for the night to the monastery of Jetavana. 
                  
                  The king was obsessed with his desire for the young woman, so he could not sleep that night. He heard some strange sounds. In the morning he went to see the Buddha about them. The Buddha told him that the sounds he heard came from the men who desired others' wives and now suffer in hell. 
                  
                  The king realized foolishness of his actions and reflected that now he knows how long is the night for the sleepless. Also the young man realized how long is the journey for one who is tired. 
                  
                  The Buddha told them by this verse that longest is the Samsara for those who are foolish and do not know the Dharma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V061] (DLMBS Commentary V061) Venerable Mahākassapa was once staying near Rājagaha. At that time he had two novices with him. One of them was very good, diligent, respectful and obedient whereas the other one was lazy, disrespectful and naughty. 
                  
                  When Kassapa admonished the bad novice, he became angry. One day he went to the village to get some food and lied that Kassapa was sick. So the people gave him very good food for Venerable Kassapa. But the novice ate all himself and came back to Kassapa empty-handed. He was admonished once again, but instead of repenting he became even angrier. 
                  
                  The next day when Kassapa left for his alms-round, the young novice broke all things and set fire to the monastery. 
                  
                  When the Buddha heard about this he spoke this verse, remarking that it would be better for Kassapa to live alone than to associate himself with such a fool.

.. [DLMBSFn-V062] (DLMBS Commentary V062) In the city of Sāvatthi there once lived a rich but very stingy man. He was extremely wealthy but he did not give anything away in charity. Before he died, he buried five pots of gold in the garden, but he did not tell his son about it. 
                  
                  He was born again in a village of beggars close to Sāvatthi. Since the time his mother became pregnant with him, the income of beggars decreased dramatically. They decided, that the boy must be unlucky, so they drove his mother and him from the village. So they begged on themselves. 
                  
                  Whenever she went begging by herself, she would get as much as before, but when she took the boy with her, she got nothing. So when the boy grew up, his mother sent him out alone to beg. 
                  
                  He wandered about in Sāvatthi and he entered his old house. His former son were frightened by him and ordered him to be thrown out of the house. 
                  
                  The Buddha happened to see this incident and he told him that the young beggar was nobody else but his own dead father. The son did not believe it, so the Buddha ordered the boy to reveal where he buried the gold. Only then did his son accept the truth and he became a disciple of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V063] (DLMBS Commentary V063) A group of Buddha's followers once went to the monastery to hear the Dharma. Two thieves joined them. One of them was busy stealing from the devotees, so he did not pay any attention to what the Buddha was saying. The other one listened and soon he understood the Dharma and stopped stealing. 
                  
                  When they returned home, the first thief laughed at the second one: "You are so stupid, you did not bring back anything! I am very wise, because I stole a lot of things." The other thief then went to the Buddha and told him what happened. 
                  
                  The Buddha explained by this verse that the fool who knows that he is a fool is wise at least to that extent, whereas the fool who thinks that he is wise can be truly called a fool.

.. [DLMBSFn-V064] (DLMBS Commentary V064) There was a monk named Udāyi, who was very ignorant. He used to sit on the platform from which the best teachers delivered the discourses. Once a group of traveling monks took him for a learned monk and gave him some questions on the Dharma. But Udāyi could not answer, because he actually did not know anything about the Dharma. The monks were surprised that somebody can stay close to the Buddha for such a long time and still know so very little. 
                  
                  The Buddha explained by this verse that although a fool associates with somebody wise even for whole his life, he still does not realize the Dharma, just as a spoon can never taste the soup, although it is used it for eating the very soup.

.. [DLMBSFn-V065] (DLMBS Commentary V065) In the city of Pāveyyaka there lived a group of young friends. Once they went to a forest and took a courtesan with them. While they were resting, the courtesan ran away with their money. While they searched for her in the forest, they met the Buddha. They stopped looking for the woman and listened to the Buddha's teachings. Immediately they all became monks and followed the Buddha to the monastery. They all practiced very diligently and soon (when the Buddha was delivering one of the discourses), they all became Arahants. 
                  
                  Some other monks were surprised, how is it possible to attain the arahantship so quickly. The Buddha explained by this verse, that an intelligent person could quickly realize the Dharma although he is associated with a wise person only for a very short time - just as the tongue tastes the soup. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V066] (DLMBS Commentary V066) There was a man named Suppabuddha. In one of his previous existences he killed a courtesan and she vowed a revenge on him. In yet another existence he spat on a holy man. 
                  
                  As a result of these actions he was born as a leper. Once he listened to the Buddha's discourse. He very quickly realized the Dharma and followed the Buddha to the monastery. 
                  
                  Sakka, the king of gods, wanted to test him and so he appeared in front of him and told him: "You are only a poor man. If you renounce the Buddha, I will give you all the wealth of the world." But Suppabuddha replied, that he was actually an extremely rich man - having the faith in the Buddha and his teaching. 
                  
                  Then Sakka related the story to the Buddha, who said that a hundred Sakkas could not turn Suppabuddha of the right path. Suppabuddha then went to see the Buddha and on the way back from the monastery an evil spirit - the woman whom he killed in a previous existence - killed him. 
                  
                  The monks asked the Buddha where was Suppabuddha reborn and the Buddha told them, that he had been reborn in Tāvatimsa heaven. By doing bad deeds over the period of several lives he accumulated a lot of defilements. These caused him so much pain and suffering, but his realizing the Dharma has cleared them away. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V067] (DLMBS Commentary V067) Some thieves were once dividing the stolen goods amongst themselves in the field. But accidentally, they left one bag of money behind. 
                  
                  Then a farmer from a nearby village started to plough that very field. The Buddha accompanied by Venerable Ānanda went by and the Buddha said: "Ānanda, look at that poisonous snake!" To which Ānanda replied: "Yes, Venerable Sir, it indeed is a very poisonous snake." The farmer was very curious so he went to investigate. He found the bag with money and took it with him. 
                  
                  Then the people who were robbed came to that place, followed the footprints of the farmer and found their money. They took the farmer to the king who ordered him executed. But on the way to the cemetery the poor man was constantly repeating the Buddha and Ānanda's words. The executioners were surprised, so they took him back to see the king. The king then brought the farmer to the presence of the Buddha. After hearing what happened that morning, the king set the farmer free and remarked that if the farmer were not able to call the Buddha as his witness, he would have been killed. 
                  
                  To that the Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a wise man should not do anything he could regret later.

.. [DLMBSFn-V068] (DLMBS Commentary V068) In the city of Rājagaha there lived a florist named Sumana. His duty was to bring the king Bimbisāra fresh jasmine flowers every morning. One day he was on his way to the palace with the flowers, when he saw the Buddha and many monks on their alms round. He felt a strong desire to offer the flowers to the Buddha. He decided that even if the king were to fire him or even kill him, he would offer the flowers to the Buddha. He did so and was filled with delightful satisfaction. 
                  
                  When Bimbisāra heard about it, he was extremely happy with what Sumana have done. He praised him for his devotion and gave him a big reward. 
                  
                  Venerable Ānanda asked the Buddha what consequences would Sumana bear for this action. The Buddha replied that Sumana would not be reborn any more in any of the lower worlds and that he will attain arahantship in the near future.

.. [DLMBSFn-V069] (DLMBS Commentary V069) In the city of Sāvatthi lived a beautiful girl named Uppalavaṇṇā. The news of her beauty traveled very far and she had many suitors from near and afar. Amongst them was her cousin Nanda who fell in love with her hopelessly. But she decided not to marry any of them and became a nun instead. One day after lightening a lamp she kept her mind fixed on the flame as her object of meditation and she attained arahantship. 
                  
                  Later she moved to the forest and lived in solitude. Once Nanda came to her hut when she was not there and hid under the couch. He was determined to take her by force if she did not agree to marry him. Uppalavaṇṇā returned and he jumped up. She tried to warn him, told him that he would have to bear consequences for his actions, but he did not listen and raped her. For this he indeed had to suffer a long period of time. 
                  
                  When the Buddha heard about this, he told King Pasenadi of Kosala about the dangers that nuns living by themselves in the forest had to face. The king built a monastery within the city and from that time on the nuns lived only in the city.

.. [DLMBSFn-V070] (DLMBS Commentary V070) In the city of Sāvatthi there lived a young man of a rich family. His name was Jambuka. He had very strange habits. He would sleep only on the floor and eat his own excrements. When he grew up, his parents sent him to the ascetics. But even those ascetics felt his habits were too disgusting so they sent him away. After that he lived alone in the forest. During the day he would stay on one leg (as he said, he was to heavy for the earth to bear him) and with his mouth open (he boasted that he lived only on air). He also used to say that he never sits down and never sleeps. But at night he slept on the floor and ate his own excrements. 
                  
                  Many people started to count themselves as his followers; they would bring him food and gifts. But he did not take anything, only sometimes he would take a little bit of food and eat it with the tip of the kusa grass, which was quite common practice for ascetics. Thus he lived many years. 
                  
                  Once the Buddha came to where he was staying and asked for a place to spend the night. Jambuka let him sleep in the nearby cave. At night, many gods and supernatural beings came to pay homage to the Buddha. Jambuka saw this and asked the Buddha what happened. 
                  
                  When the Buddha told him that these beings were gods, Jambuka was impressed. He told the Buddha that he must be a very holy person, because although he himself spent years standing on one leg and eating only air, no god ever came to pay homage to him. The Buddha told him that he could not be fooled. He said that he knew very well that Jambuka slept on the ground every night and ate his excrements. 
                  
                  The Buddha also explained, that during one of his previous existences Jambuka had prevented a certain monk to go obtain alms food and how he threw away the food that was sent with him for that very monk. As a result of these actions he was born with these strange habits. 
                  
                  Jambuka realized his mistakes and paid respects to the Buddha. The Buddha delivered a discourse, at the end of which Jambuka attained arahantship and became one of the Buddha's monks. 
                  
                  When Jambuka's followers arrived they were surprised to see their teacher with the Buddha. Jambuka announced that he was now a member of Buddha's Sangha, the Order and a disciple of the Buddha. The Buddha explained that the cruelest austerities practiced for a long period of time are not worth even one-sixteenth of understanding of the true Dharma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V071] (DLMBS Commentary V071) Once the Venerable Moggallāna with Venerable Lakkhana were on alms round in the city of Rājagaha. Suddenly Venerable Moggallāna smiled but did not say anything. When they returned to the monastery, Lakkhana asked why he smiled. Moggallāna explained, that he saw a peta-ghost in the village. The Buddha then said that he himself saw that very peta on the day he attained awakenment. In one of his previous existences it was a rich landowner. There lived an Individual Buddha (Paccekabuddha) close to one of his fields. People who went to pay their respects to this Buddha had to pass through his field. He feared that this would damage the field and so he set fire to it. So the Buddha had to move to some other place. Because of this evil deed he was reborn as a peta-ghost. 
                  
                  At the end the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that although at the time of the evil action it may seem there are no consequences, they will surely come in the future. Because we cannot see the fire through the ashes it is covered with, does not mean there is no fire at all. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V072] (DLMBS Commentary V072) Venerable Moggallāna once saw a peta-ghost on one of his alms rounds. The Buddha then related the story about this particular ghost. He said, that a long time ago he was a man very skilful in throwing stones. He studied this art for a long time and then he asked his teacher for permission to try his skills. His teacher warned him not to hit cows or people - he would have to pay compensations to the owner of the cow or the relatives of that person. 
                  
                  This foolish man then went out and saw a holy man. Since the holy man had no relatives, he thought that this would be a good practice target. So he threw stones at the holy man and killed him. The public then became very angry and killed the man in turn. Besides, he was reborn many times in very miserable states. In this present existence, he was reborn as a peta-ghost whose head was being hit with hot hammers. 
                  
                  The Buddha then explained by this verse that a fool gains knowledge only for his misfortune, because he does not know how to use it properly and certainly it will cause him some harm.

.. [DLMBSFn-V073] (DLMBS Commentary V073) A householder named Citta once met Venerable Mahānāma, one of the first Buddha's disciples. When listening to the discourse given by him, Citta realized the Dharma. Therefore, he built a monastery in his mango grove and installed a monk named Sudhamma as the resident monk. 
                  
                  On day, Venerable Moggallāna and Venerable Sāriputta came to the monastery. They gave a discourse and after hearing it, Citta attained the third stage of Awakenment. He then invited Moggallāna and Sāriputta to his house for alms food the next day. After that he also invited Sudhamma, but he refused, saying that he was invited only after the other two were. Citta repeated his invitation, but Sudhamma again turned it down. 
                  
                  But the next day Sudhamma came to the Citta's house nevertheless. He was invited inside, but he refused, saying that he was on his alms round. But when he saw tasty food being prepared for Moggallāna and Sāriputta he got envious and angry. He told Citta that he did not want to live in his monastery any longer. 
                  
                  Sudhamma then reported to the Buddha what happened. The Buddha told him, "You have offended a faithful and generous lay disciple. You must go back and apologize for your mistake!" Sudhamma did so, but Citta felt that he still did not realize his mistake fully and refused his apology. Sudhamma went back to the Buddha, who admonished him with this verse (and the following one, see DhP 74). He said, "You should not be attached to this or that dwelling, to this or that lay disciple - in this way the pride and envy will increase." 
                  
                  Sudhamma went back to the Citta's house and this time Citta accepted the apology. Not long after that, Sudhamma attained Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V074] (DLMBS Commentary V074) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one, as they actually form two parts of one rather long verse (see DhP 73). 
                  
                  As with the monk Sudhamma in the story, if we become too attached to our surroundings, if we identify ourselves with it, our desires will grow. If we feel that only we know how to do things and if we expect everybody to follow our leadership in whatever has to be done, our pride will only increase. Needles to say, desire and pride are hindrances on the way to Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V075] (DLMBS Commentary V075) In the city of Sāvatthi lived a well-known man. He often offered alms food to the monks and especially to Venerable Sāriputta. He had a son named Tissa. At the age of seven, the young boy Tissa became a novice under Sāriputta. While living at the Jetavana monastery, relatives would visit him often and bring him many presents. Soon he was tired of these visits so he took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and moved away to the forest monastery. While there, he devoted himself to meditation. Whenever villagers offered him alms, he said just, "May you be well and happy!" After three months of meditation he attained arahantship. 
                  
                  Then Venerable Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and other senior monks paid visit to Tissa. Villagers requested Sāriputta to deliver a discourse, but he let speak Tissa instead. Villagers were not pleased, because they never heard anything from Tissa except for the words "May you be well and happy!" They thought he did not really understand Dharma. 
                  
                  But Tissa gave a discourse and spoke for the whole night. Villagers were impressed and felt lucky that they have such a wise monk with them. But still they were a bit angry with him for not speaking earlier. 
                  
                  Then the Buddha came to the village and told the villagers how lucky they were. If it was not for Tissa, would they all, the Buddha and so many senior monks, come to the village? The villagers realized their luck and did not think about the past any more.

.. [DLMBSFn-V076] (DLMBS Commentary V076) A poor old man named Rādha was staying in the monastery doing manual work, like sweeping, cutting the grass etc. He wanted to become a monk, but the elders were not willing to admit him. 

                  One day the Buddha saw that Rādha had a potential to become an arahant, so he called the monks and asked them if any of them recollects a good deed done by Rādha. Venerable Sāriputta said that Rādha once offered him some rice. The Buddha then asked if it wasn't proper to repay the kindness by accepting the man into the Order and show him the way out of suffering. So Rādha became a monk under Venerable Sāriputta. He strictly followed Sāriputta's guidance and in a very short time he attained arahantship. 
                  
                  When the Buddha heard about this he explained by this verse that a monk should always be attentive to guidance by his betters and not resent rebukes for his faults.

.. [DLMBSFn-V077] (DLMBS Commentary V077) There were two monks, Assaji and Punabhasuka, staying in the village of Kitāgiri together with their disciples. They planted trees for personal gain and violated some other minor monks' precepts. Thus, the monastery became noisy and not suitable for spiritual development. 
                  
                  When the Buddha heard about it, he sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to advise these monks. After the admonition from the two Buddha's chief disciples, most of the monks changed their way of life. But some of them were not happy and returned to the household life. 
                  
                  The Buddha reacted with this verse, saying that admonishing and instructing is always fine with the good ones, whereas the bad ones never agree to being advised.

.. [DLMBSFn-V078] (DLMBS Commentary V078) Channa was Prince Siddhattha's servant before he renounced the world. When he left the palace and went to homelessness, Channa accompanied him part of the way. After he became the Buddha, Channa also left the worldly life and became a monk. But on account of his close connection with the Buddha, he was very proud and arrogant. He used to scold Sāriputta and Moggallāna, envying them their positions as two Buddha's chief disciples. 
                  
                  The Buddha admonished him several times, but Channa still continued to abuse as before. This went on for a long time. Just before the Buddha passed away, he told Ānanda that after his death, a special punishment should be imposed on Channa - nobody was to talk to him, nobody was to associate with him. 
                  
                  When Channa learned about this, he felt a deep remorse for his behavior. He admitted his mistake and apologized. After that he changed his ways, practiced diligently and soon he became an Arahant.

.. [DLMBSFn-V079] (DLMBS Commentary V079) King Mahākappina ruled in Kukkutavati. Once he heard from some merchants about the Buddha and his teachings. He and several of his ministers immediately left for Sāvatthi, where the Buddha was staying at that time. 
                  
                  They met the Buddha sitting under a tree on the bank of a river. After listening to his teachings, they immediately realized the Dharma and became monks. 
                  
                  When he did not return, his queen and wives of the ministers followed them to Sāvatthi. When they arrived there, the Buddha hid the former king and his ministers, because he knew that if the women saw their husbands in yellow robes and with their heads shaved, it would be impossible for them to realize the Dharma. So he just told them to sit down and listen to what he had to say, their husbands would join them soon. He then delivered a discourse. At the end the king and his ministers (they were sitting nearby) attained arahantship and the queen and the wives of the ministers attained the first stage of awakenment. The ladies also joined the Order and soon became arahants too. 
                  
                  Venerable Mahākappina would often exclaim: "Oh, what happiness!" When the other monks asked the Buddha what he meant, he replied with this verse, explaining that Mahākappina tasted the nectar of the Dharma and found it extremely sweet. He therefore lives happily, with a bright mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V080] (DLMBS Commentary V080) Venerable Sāriputta once had a very young novice. On the eighth day after becoming a novice he was with Sāriputta on an alms-round. He observed irrigators irrigating the fields, arrow-makers making their arrows and carpenters working with wood. He asked Venerable Sāriputta if those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever one wishes. Sāriputta replied that it is so. The young novice then thought, "If those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever one wishes, then why could not I master myself?" 
                  
                  He then asked permission from Sāriputta, returned to the monastery and diligently practiced. Very soon he attained the third stage of awakenment and was very close to attaining full arahantship. 
                  
                  Sāriputta then returned and was going towards the novice's hut. The Buddha saw this and he also saw that the novice was just about to attain the goal, so he met Sāriputta outside and prevented him from going to the novice's hut by asking him various questions. The novice indeed attained arahantship very soon and the Buddha explained that the reason, why he kept Sāriputta outside, was to enable the young novice to attain his goal without being interrupted.

.. [DLMBSFn-V081] (DLMBS Commentary V081) At the Jetavana monastery lived a monk named Bhaddiya. Because he was very short, other monks would often tease him. Younger monks would pull his nose or pat him on the head and ask, "Uncle, how are you? Are you bored with your life as a monk?"But Bhaddiya was extremely good-natured and he never retaliated in anger. 
                  
                  Somebody once mentioned Bhaddiya's patience in front of the Buddha. The Buddha replied by this verse and he added, that Arahants are like that - they never loose temper for whatever reason. They are like mountain rocks - unmovable by the "wind" of praise or blame. Only then did the other monks understand, that this funny short Bhaddiya was actually an Arahant.

.. [DLMBSFn-V082] (DLMBS Commentary V082) In one village there lived a woman named Kāṇa Mātā. She was a devout lay disciple of the Buddha. She had a daughter Kāṇa who was married to a man from another village. Once she was staying with her mother and her husband sent for her. But her mother told her to wait, because she wanted to send some cakes to her husband. 
                  
                  But the next day some monks came to the house and Kāṇa Mātā gave the cakes to them. Kāṇa had to wait for her mother to prepare new cakes and she could not return to her husband. This happened every day for three following days. All the cakes were given to the monks. 
                  Kāṇa's husband then took another wife. Kāṇa accused the monks that they have ruined her marriage and became very bitter. She would insult and abuse the monks, wherever she saw them. 
                  
                  The Buddha then set a new rule for the monks, not to take advantage of the devotion of the lay disciples. He went to Kāṇa Mātā's house and asked Kāṇa if the monks took what was given or what was not given. Kāṇa replied that they took only what was given to them and realized that she was wrong. The Buddha then gave a discourse. At the end, Kāṇa attained the first stage of Arahantship. 
                  
                  King Pasenadi of Kosala heard about this, summoned Kāṇa to the palace and one of his ministers adopted her as his daughter. Every day she gave offerings to holy people who came to her door. 
                  
                  The Buddha then noted that Kāṇa's mind, originally confused and "muddy" became clear as a lake after listening to the Dharma. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V083] (DLMBS Commentary V083) The Buddha and many monks once stayed for the Rain Retreat in the village of Veranja at a request of a Brahmin from that village. But for some reason the Brahmin did not look after them. Moreover, there was a famine in the region and people could not support them very well. But the monks were all contented and happy. Some horse traders offered them grain every day and they lived on that food and continued to practice meditation diligently. 
                  
                  When the Rains were over, the Buddha and the monks returned to Savatthi. At that time, a certain group of people was permitted to stay in the monastery. They only ate greedily, slept and played on the bank of the river. There was a lot of noise in the monastery and around it. 
                  
                  When monks remarked to the Buddha that people were so depressed during the famine and now, when it was over, they were so elated. The Buddha replied with this verse, adding that only the foolish are full of sorrow when things do not go well and extremely happy when everything is fine. The wise is always calm and equanimous whether they have to face good or bad things.

.. [DLMBSFn-V084] (DLMBS Commentary V084) In the city of Savatthi, there lived a man with his pregnant wife. He wanted to become a monk so he asked his wife for permission. She told him to wait after the baby is born. When it happened, she again asked him to stay until the child could walk. When the man finally got to be a monk, he took a subject of meditation, practiced diligently and soon attained arahantship. 
                  
                  A few years later he visited his house in order to teach Dharma to his family. His son became a monk too and soon he also became an Arahant. The wife thought, "If both my husband and my son entered the Order, I'd better go too." So she left the house and became a nun. Eventually she too attained arahantship. 
                  
                  The Buddha was told how the whole family attained arahantship and he replied by this verse. He added, that a wise man works for his liberation and helps others towards the same goal. The awakenment can be realized only after much effort.

.. [DLMBSFn-V085] (DLMBS Commentary V085) One day, a group of people came to the monastery to give offerings to the monks and listen to the discourses. It was arranged that they could stay the whole night and listen to the monks explaining the Dharma. 
                  
                  But some of them did not have enough energy and they returned home early. Some stayed for the night, but were sleepy and did not pay much attention to what was being said. Only a few were able to listen attentively to the discourses. 
                  
                  In the morning the Buddha was told about what happened. He replied by this verse, saying that most people are too attached to this world, only a few are able to reach the other shore and attain Nirvana. 
                  
                  He reminded the monks to strive diligently for the goal; only those who will do se will be able to reach the perfection of mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V086] (DLMBS Commentary V086) The story for this verse is identical to the story for the previous one. 
                  
                  It is not easy to reach the Nirvana, even if we practice diligently for a long time. Most people, although they listen to the discourses, read books and meditate, are not able to really cut the ties to "this shore" and realize the arahantship. Only when one is really living the Dharma for a long time and fully, one is able to achieve this goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V087] (DLMBS Commentary V087) A group of monks came to see the Buddha and asked him for advice on meditation. The Buddha advised them with this verse and with the two following ones (DhP 88, DhP 89). 
                  
                  In order to be able to devote oneself completely to the practice of meditation, one must "give up the bad states". These are evil deeds, evil thoughts. Then one must develop "good states", or good deeds and good thoughts. If one wants to practice wholeheartedly, it is very good to "go the houselessness", or in other words to became a monk or a nun and meditate diligently in solitude. That is extremely difficult, because in solitude there is nothing "to enjoy", nothing for our mind to occupy itself with, we are left only with ourselves and have to concentrate on the practice.

.. [DLMBSFn-V088] (DLMBS Commentary V088) A group of monks came to see the Buddha and asked him for advice on meditation. The Buddha advised them with this verse and with the preceding and the following one (DhP 87, DhP 89). 
                  
                  In order to reach the awakenment, one must abandon all cravings and "have nothing", or in other words, not cling to anything. One must also purify the mind from the "impurities", or greed, hate, delusion, conceit, speculative views, skeptical doubt, mental torpor, restlessness, shamelessness and lack of moral dread. 
                  
                  This way, one will reach the state of arahantship and then one can truly find delight in solitude.

.. [DLMBSFn-V089] (DLMBS Commentary V089) A group of monks came to see the Buddha and asked him for advice on meditation. The Buddha advised them with this verse and with the two preceeding ones (DhP 87, DhP 88). 
                  
                  In order to reach the awakenment, one must fully develop the "constituents of awakenment". They are seven: mindfulness (**sati**), investigation of the Dharma (**dhammavicaya**), energy (**viriya**), joy (**piti**), tranquility (**passadhi**), concentration (**samadhi**) and equanimity (**upekkha**). We also must not cling to anything and take delight in renouncing all the attachments. Most importantly, we must "remove the taints". Traditionally, these four taints (**asava**) are mentioned in the texts: sense desire (**kama**), desiring eternal existence (**bhava**), wrong views (**ditthi**) and ignorance (**avijja**). If we remove these taints, we will "shine" with wisdom and be truly completely emancipated from the suffering.

.. [NāradaFn07-01]  (Ven. Nārada 07-01) Arahanta has several meanings. It may be interpreted as "Worthy One". "Passionless One". Or one who commits no evil even secretly. He has got rid of both death and birth. After death, in conventional terms, he attains parinibbāna. Until his death he serves other seekers of truth by example and by precept.

.. [NāradaFn07-02]  (Ven. Nārada 07-02) Of life in the round of existence, i.e., an Arahant.

.. [NāradaFn07-03]  (Ven. Nārada 07-03) Sabbadhi, the five Aggregates, etc.

.. [NāradaFn07-04]  (Ven. Nārada 07-04) One gives up sorrow by attaining Anāgāmi, the third stage of Sainthood. It is at this stage one eradicates completely attachment to sense-desires and ill-will or aversion.

.. [NāradaFn07-05]  (Ven. Nārada 07-05) There are four kinds of ganthas (Ties) - namely: i. covetousness (abhijjhā). ii. ill-will (vyāpāda). iii. indulgence in (wrongful) rites and ceremonies (sīlabbataparāmāsa), and iv. adherence to one's preconceptions as truth (idaṃ saccābhinivesa).

.. [NāradaFn07-06]  (Ven. Nārada 07-06) This verse refers to the ethical state of an Arahant. Heat is both physical and mental. An Arahant experiences bodily heat as long as he is alive, but is not thereby worried. Mental heat of passions he experiences not.

.. [NāradaFn07-07]  (Ven. Nārada 07-07) Arahants wander whithersoever they like without any attachment to any particular place as they are free from the conception of "I" and "mine".

.. [NāradaFn07-08]  (Ven. Nārada 07-08) There are two kinds of accumulation- namely: kammic activities and the four necessaries of life. The former tend to prolong life in Saṃsāra and the latter, though essential, may prove an obstacle to spiritual progress.

.. [NāradaFn07-09]  (Ven. Nārada 07-09) To get rid of the desire for food.

.. [NāradaFn07-10]  (Ven. Nārada 07-10) Nibbāna is Deliverance from suffering (vimokkha). It is called Void because it is void of lust, hatred and ignorance, not because it is nothingness or annihilation. Nibbāna is a positive supramundane state which cannot be expressed in mundane words. It is Signless because it is free from the signs of lust etc., Arahants experience Nibbānic bliss while alive. It is not correct to say that Arahants exist after death or do not exist after death, for Nibbāna is neither eternalism nor nihilism. In Nibbāna nothing is eternalised nor is anything, except passions, annihilated. Arahants experience Nibbānic bliss by attaining to the fruit of Arahantship in this life itself.

.. [NāradaFn07-11]  (Ven. Nārada 07-11) By indakhīla is meant either a column as firm and high as that of Sakka's, or the chief column that stands at the entrance to a city. Commentators state that these indakhīlas are firm posts which are erected either inside or outside the city as an embellishment. Usually they are made of bricks or of durable wood and are octagonal in shape. Half of the post is embedded in the earth, hence the metaphor 'as firm and steady as an indakhīla'.

.. [NāradaFn07-12]  (Ven. Nārada 07-12) Tādi is one who has neither attachment to desirable objects nor aversion to undesirable objects. Nor does he cling to anything. Amidst the eight worldly conditions - gain and loss, fame and infamy, blame and praise, happiness and pain - an Arahant remains unperturbed, manifesting neither attachment nor aversion, neither elation nor depression.

.. [NāradaFn07-13]  (Ven. Nārada 07-13) As they are not subject to birth and death. See note on saṃsāra, vs 60.

.. [NāradaFn07-16]  (Ven. Nārada 07-16) The pun in the original Pāëi is lost in the translation.

.. [NāradaFn07-17]  (Ven. Nārada 07-17) Assaddho, lit. unfaithful. He does not merely accept from other sources because he himself knows from personal experience.

.. [NāradaFn07-18]  (Ven. Nārada 07-18) Akata, Nibbāna. It is so called because it is not created by anyone. Akataññū can also be interpreted as ungrateful.

.. [NāradaFn07-19]  (Ven. Nārada 07-19) The links of existence and rebirth. Sandhicchedo also means a housebreaker, that is, a burglar.

.. [NāradaFn07-20]  (Ven. Nārada 07-20) Hata + avakāso - he who has destroyed the opportunity.

.. [NāradaFn07-21]  (Ven. Nārada 07-21) Vanta + āso he who eats vomit is another meaning.

.. [NāradaFn07-23]  (Ven. Nārada 07-23) Ninna and thala, lit., low-lying and elevated grounds.

.. [NāradaFn07-24]  (Ven. Nārada 07-24) The passionless Arahants rejoice in secluded forests which have no attraction for worldlings.

.. [ThaniSFn-V92-93] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 92-93) "Having understood food... independent of nutriment": The first question in the Novice's Questions (Khp 4) is "What is one?" The answer: "All animals subsist on nutriment." The concept of food and nutriment here refers to the most basic way of understanding the causal principle that plays such a central role in the Buddha's teaching. As SN 12.64 points out, "There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. Which four? Physical nutriment, gross or refined; contact as the second, consciousness the third, and intellectual intention the fourth." The present verses make the point that the arahant has so fully understood the process of physical and mental causality that he/she is totally independent of it, and thus will never take birth again. Such a person cannot be comprehended by any of the forms of understanding that operate within the causal realm.

.. [ThaniSFn-V94] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 94) "Such (tadin)": an adjective used to describe one who has attained the goal of Buddhist practice, indicating that the person's state is indefinable but not subject to change or influences of any sort. "Right knowing": the knowledge of full Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V95] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 95) Indra's pillar = a post set up at the gate of a city. According to DhpA, there was an ancient custom of worshipping this post with flowers and offerings, although those who wanted to show their disrespect for this custom would urinate and defecate on the post. In either case, the post did not react.

.. [ThaniSFn-V97] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 97) This verse is a series of puns. The negative meanings of the puns are on the left side of the slashes; the positive meanings, on the right. The negative meanings are so extremely negative that they were probably intended to shock their listeners. One scholar has suggested that the last word — uttamaporiso, the ultimate person — should also be read as a pun, with the negative meaning, "the extreme of audacity," but that would weaken the shock value of the verse.

.. [BudRkFn-v97]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 97) In the Pali this verse presents a series of puns, and if the "underside" of each pun were to be translated, the verse would read thus: "The man who is faithless, ungrateful, a burglar, who destroys opportunities and eats vomit — he truly is the most excellent of men."

.. [DLMBSFn-V090] (DLMBS Commentary V090) Devadatta once tried to kill the Buddha by pushing a big rock on him from the top of the mountain. But the rock split and only one splinter hurt the Buddha's foot. The physician Jivaka attended on him. He applied some medicine and promised to come back and take the bandage off in the evening. But he was held by some other business and the city gates were already closed when he wanted to go to the monastery. He knew that the bandage had to be taken off that night, so he was very distressed. 

                  The next morning, Jivaka hurried to see the Buddha, only to find out that Venerable Ananda helped the Buddha to take the bandage off the previous night and the wound has already healed completely! So Jivaka asked if the Buddha felt any pain. The Buddha replied by this verse, saying that for those, who have reached the awakenment, there was no pain.

.. [DLMBSFn-V091] (DLMBS Commentary V091) The Buddha once spent the Rain Retreat in the city of Rajagaha. With the end of the retreat he was getting ready to leave the city, so he told the monks to prepare for the journey. Venerable Kassapa was also preparing his robes. Some monks speculated if Kassapa would really leave Rajagaha - there were so many people who respected him very much and considered themselves his disciples. 
                  
                  The Buddha then decided that some monks should stay in Rajagaha, to offer spiritual guidance, to ordain new monks etc. He told Venerable Kassapa to stay in the monastery with some junior monks and take care of these things. 
                  
                  The other monks remarked that they predicted Kassapa would not accompany the Buddha this time. The Buddha overheard these conversations and said, "Do you think that Kassapa stays in Rajagaha because he is attached to his disciples? You are mistaken. Kassapa has no attachments anywhere!" He further added this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V092] (DLMBS Commentary V092) Venerable Belatthi Sisa went on an almsround in a village. When he had enough food, he stopped on the way and ate. Then he continued on his almsround for more food. When he returned to the monastery, he dried the rice up and stored it. In this way he could concentrate only on his practice of meditation. Every day he would soak the rice in some water and eat it. The other monks saw this and thought that he is lazy and greedy. They reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha saw that if this practice became a habit amongst all monks, it could lead to laziness and greed and he discouraged the monks from hoarding food. 
                  But because Belatthi Sisa did not store the rice out of greed for food, but only to save time for more meditation practice, the Buddha declared that he should not be blamed in any way. 
                  
                  He also added this verse, saying that the Arahants are not greedy for anything and they take food just to sustain the body in good condition, not for pleasure.

.. [DLMBSFn-V093] (DLMBS Commentary V093) Venerable Anuruddha was once looking for discarded pieces of cloth in order to make himself a new robe. His wife Jalini from a previous existence, who was now a god, saw him. She brought three pieces of a very good material and put them on the rubbish heap. Venerable Anuruddha found them and took them back to the monastery to make his robe. 
                  
                  The Buddha and other senior disciples then arrived to the monastery and they also helped him to make the robe. Jalini then urged the villagers to bring lots of delicious food to the monastery, so there was more than enough for everyone. Some monks remarked that Anuruddha wanted to show off that he had many devotees, so he made them to bring so much good food. The Buddha overheard these conversations and said that Anuruddha did not ask anyone for anything. Arahants do not ask for food or clothes. They have removed their taints and are free and without attachments. Traditionally, the four taints (**āsava**) are mentioned in the texts: sense desire (**kāma**), desiring eternal existence (**bhava**), wrong views (**diṭṭhi**) and ignorance (**avijjā**).

.. [DLMBSFn-V094] (DLMBS Commentary V094) One day Sakka, the chief of the gods, came to the monastery to pay homage to the Buddha. Venerable Maha Kaccayana was not in the monastery at that time and a seat was kept prepared for him. Sakka with the gods paid homage to the Buddha and then he declared his wish that Kaccayana would also be present so that he could pay homage also to him. At that moment Kaccayana arrived. Sakka was very happy and paid his respect to him. 
                  
                  Some monks accused Sakka of favoritism. Bu the Buddha replied with this verse, saying that who is restrained in his senses, even gods envy him his calm and respect him enormously.

.. [DLMBSFn-V095] (DLMBS Commentary V095) Once a certain monk approached the Buddha and complained, that Venerable Sariputta has abused and beaten him. The Buddha sent for Sariputta and asked him if it was true. Sariputta was extremely humble and replied, "I am like the earth, I feel no pleasure or pain, I am like a door mat, like a beggar, I am not attached to my body any more. How could I not apologize to a fellow monk for a wrong doing?" 
                  
                  The monk felt remorse and admitted that he accused Sariputta wrongly, because he was angry with him for some small matter. He asked Sariputta for pardon. The Buddha advised Sariputta to accept the apology. Sariputta pardoned the monk and also asked him to be forgiven if he had done anything wrong. 
                  
                  The Budha then spoke this verse, saying that an Arahant is like the earth, or like an Indra's stake - he is patient and firm, serene and pure like a clear lake.

.. [DLMBSFn-V096] (DLMBS Commentary V096) Once a young seven years old boy became a novice under Venerable Tissa. While his head was being shaved, he kept his mind fixed on the object of meditation and attained arahantship immediately.
                  
                  After a time, Venerable Tissa and the young novice set out on a journey to Savatthi to see the Buddha. On the way they stayed in a village monastery. Tissa went to sleep, but the young novice fell asleep only before the dawn. When Tissa woke up, he wanted to wake up also the novice. So he roused him with a palm-leaf fan. Accidentally he hit his eye with the handle and damaged his eye. The novice did not say anything, covered his eye with one hand and performed his duties - swept the floor and brought water to Tissa. When Tissa saw the novice offering him water with just one hand, he remarked that he should do it with both hands. The novice uncovered his eye and only then Tissa found out that the novice lost an eye. He also realized that he must be an Arahant! He felt very sorry and immediately started to apologize to the boy. But the novice said it was not Tissa's fault, it was only ripening of his old karma. Tissa just could not forget the whole story and he felt very depressed. 
                  
                  When they arrived in Savatthi, Tissa related the story to the Buddha. He replied with this verse, saying that an Arahant does not get angry with anyone, he is perfectly calm and peaceful.

.. [DLMBSFn-V097] (DLMBS Commentary V097) A group of monks came from a village to pay their respects to the Buddha. The Buddha sent for Sariputta and asked him, "Sariputta, do you believe, that one can attain Nirvana by being mindful of the senses?" Sariputta replied, "I do not simply believe in this because I have faith on you and your teaching. Only those who have no personal experience accept the facts from others." The monks did not understand it and thought that Sariputta doesn't have faith in the Buddha, that he did not given up wrong views yet. 
                  
                  The Buddha explained that Sariputta accepts the fact that Nirvana can be attained by being mindful of senses by his own personal experience, because he already attained arahantship. He does not simply trust blindly in his teacher's words without testing them with his own practice. Blind faith has no place in Buddhism, only the trust in the method, which must be followed by one's own personal experience.

.. [DLMBSFn-V098] (DLMBS Commentary V098) Revata was the brother of Venerable Sariputta and he was the only one who has not become a monk. His parents wanted him to get married and so they arranged a marriage for him while he was still very young. At the wedding ceremony he saw a very old woman and realized that all beings are subject to old age, illness and eventually death. He was horrified and immediately left for the monastery. He was admitted into the Order and became a novice. 
                  
                  He stayed alone in the forest, kept meditating diligently and very soon he attained arahantship. The Buddha, Sariputta and many other monks set out on a journey to visit him. 
                  
                  The journey was long and the area was uninhabited by people, but gods looked to the needs of the Buddha and monks. When they arrived, Revata also used his supernatural powers and created a monastery for the Buddha and the monks to stay. The Buddha remarked that wherever the Arahant lives, the place is always beautiful and delightful.

.. [DLMBSFn-V099] (DLMBS Commentary V099) A certain monk received a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to an old garden at the outskirts of the city. Some lascivious woman came into the garden and as there was nobody else around she tried to seduce the monk. She unloosened her hair, began to undress and laugh. The monk became very excited and upset. He did not know what to do. 
                  
                  The Buddha saw this from afar and told the monk this verse, saying that in seeking passions there is no delight. Only after freeing oneself from passion can one enjoy whatever place one is at. The monk did not care about the woman any more and attained arahantship quickly.

.. [NāradaFn08-03] (Ven. Nārada 08-03) Sahassaṃ sahassena, thousand multiplied by a thousand, that is, ten lakhs. (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn08-04] (Ven. Nārada 08-04) Atta -The Buddha often uses this term in the sense of oneself or mind but not in the sense of a soul or special self.

.. [NāradaFn08-05] (Ven. Nārada 08-05) A class of beings who are supposed to be heavenly musicians.

.. [NāradaFn08-06] (Ven. Nārada 08-06) Here Māra is used in the sense of god.

.. [NāradaFn08-07] (Ven. Nārada 08-07) Another class of beings, even superior to the gods in heaven, who have developed the Jhānas (ecstasies).

.. [NāradaFn08-08] (Ven. Nārada 08-08) According to the Commentary iññhaṃ is that which is given on festival occasions, and hutaṃ is that which is prepared and given either to guests or with a belief in kamma and results. The idea conveyed by this stanza is that reverence paid to a Saint is far superior to gifts and alms given to worldlings.

.. [NāradaFn08-09] (Ven. Nārada 08-09) They are the Sotāpannas (Stream-Winners) and others who have attained sanctification.

.. [NāradaFn08-10] (Ven. Nārada 08-10) Nirodha-samāpatti. This is a state when the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases to flow. When in such a state, a Saint is immune from danger.

.. [NāradaFn08-11] (Ven. Nārada 08-11) The rise and decay of mind and matter - namely: the impermanence of all conditioned things. A disciple of the Buddha is expected to contemplate the fleeting nature of life, so that he may not be attached to illusory material pleasures.

.. [NāradaFn08-12] (Ven. Nārada 08-12) Amataṃ padaṃ, the unconditioned state of Nibbāna, free from birth, decay and death.

.. [NāradaFn08-13] (Ven. Nārada 08-13) The nine supramundane States - namely: the four Paths, the four Fruits, and Nibbāna.

.. [BudRkFn-v104]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 104) Brahma: a high divinity in ancient Indian religion.

.. [ThaniSFn-V100] (Ven. Thanissaro V.100) According to DhpA, the word sahassam in this and the following verses means "by the thousands" rather than "a thousand." The same principle would also seem to hold for satam — "by the hundreds" rather than "a hundred" — in 102.

.. [ThaniSFn-V108] (Ven. Thanissaro V.108) "Doesn't come to a fourth": DhpA: The merit produced by all sacrificial offerings given in the world in the course of a year doesn't equal even one fourth of the merit made by paying homage once to one who has gone the straight way to Unbinding.

.. [DLMBSFn-V100] (DLMBS Commentary V100) Once there was a former public executioner named Tambadathika. Once he went for a bath to the river and took some food with him. Just as he was leaving the house, Venerable Sāriputta stopped by his door on his way for almsfood. Tambadathika offered him his food. 

                  After the meal, Sāriputta taught him the Dharma. But Tambadathika's mind was not peaceful, because he was disturbed and feeling remorse recollecting his past work. This did not allow him to pay attention to the Dharma. Sāriputta asked him if he killed those people because he wanted to, out of hate or anger – or was it just an order. Tambadathika replied that he was ordered to kill them by the king and personally did not feel hate towards them. So Sāriputta reassured him that he did nothing wrong. Tambadathika then calmed down and listened to the Dharma attentively. He then accompanied Sāriputta on the way back to the monastery. But on the way back home he died due to an accident. 
                  
                  The Buddha was told about this and he remarked that Tambadathika was reborn in Tusita heaven. The monks wondered how it was possible for somebody who killed so many people in his life to be reborn there. The Buddha told them by this verse that just one meaningful sentence that helped his mind to calm down and concentrate on the Dharma helped him to achieve this goal. For if one dies with a peaceful mind, one's rebirth is good. If at the time of death our mind is confused or angry - we face a bad rebirth.

.. [DLMBSFn-V101] (DLMBS Commentary V101) Some merchants sailed in a boat. Their boat was wrecked and only one of them, named Bāhiya, survived. He got hold of a piece of wood and came to land in the city of Suppāraka. He tied a piece of bark to his body and sat in a public place. People gave him food; some thought that he was a holy man so they paid their respects to him. Some people offered him clothes but he refused. Everybody started to tell him that he was an Arahant so he began to consider himself one. 

                  Now the god Brahma was a friend of Bāhiya's in one of previous lives. He came to see him one night and told him that he certainly was not an Arahant. Bāhiya asked if there are Arahants at all and where to find them. Brahma sent him to the city of Sāvatthi to see the Buddha. 

                  Bāhiya immediately set on a journey to Sāvatthi. He did not rest much because he was anxious to meet the Buddha. Therefore when he arrived at Sāvatthi he was extremely tired. He met the Buddha going on an almsround with some other monks. He asked the Buddha to teach him the Dharma, but the Buddha refused saying that it was not a proper time for a discourse. But Bāhiya pleaded again and the Buddha realized that Bāhiya is ready to become an Arahant. So he told him: "Bāhiya, when you see a thing, be conscious only of the object. When you hear a sound, be conscious only of the sound. When you smell, taste, or touch anything, be conscious only of the smell, taste, or touch. When you think of anything, be conscious only of the mental object." 

                  Bāhiya did this and immediately he attained Arahantship. He asked permission to be admitted into the Order as a monk. The Buddha agreed, but first he sent him to find some robes, the bowl and other requisites. Bāhiya went to find these things, but on the way he was attacked by a wild animal and died. When the Buddha and monks went back from the almsround, they found him laying dead on the road. The Buddha instructed the monks to cremate Bāhiya's body and erect a stupa around the ashes. 

                  The Buddha then told the monks that Bāhiya has attained Arahantship. He proclaimed that Bāhiya was the quickest of all his disciples to do so. Some monks wondered how it was possible to attain Awakenment just after listening to a few words on the road. The Buddha then explained by this verse that the number of words or the length of the speech does not really matter if one's mind is really ready. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V102] (DLMBS Commentary V102) In the city of Rājagaha there lived a girl named Kuṇḍala Kesi. She was a daughter of a very rich man. Once she saw a thief who was being led to be executed. She felt in love with him and threatened to die uless she could marry him. 

                  Her parents therefore bribed the executioner and they married their daughter to the thief. But he was interested only in Kuṇḍala Kesi's wealth and did not love her. One day he told her to put one her best clothes and jewelry and took her to the top of the mountain saying he wanted to pay respects to the guardian spirits for saving his life. But when they reached the place, the thief wanted to kill her, take her jewels and run away. Kuṇḍala Kesi begged him to take her things but to spare her life. Her husband had no mercy and still wanted to kill her. Therefore she realized that in order to save herself, she must kill him. She pretended she wanted to pay him her respects for the last time and when she was behind him, she pushed him off the mountain. 

                  The guardian spirit of the mountain applauded her, saying that from this one can clearly see that wisdom is not found only amongst men, that women are also very wise. 

                  Kuṇḍala Kesi then did not return home, but became a disciple of some ascetics. She quickly mastered their teachings and they sent her to find some better teachers. She wandered around and challenged everyone to dispute with her. Many did - but she defeated them all, since no one could answer her questions. 

                  Once she arrived in Sāvatthi. She made a small hill of sand and put a branch on top of it, thus inviting everybody for a dispute. Venerable Sāriputta took up this challenge. Kuṇḍala Kesi asked him many questions, but Sāriputta answered all of them without hesitation. Then it was his turn to ask questions. He asked just one question, "What is the meaning of One?" She was not able to answer, therefore she asked Sāriputta to teach her. Sāriputta told her the answer: "All the beings in the world are sustained by one thing - food." Kuṇḍala Kesi became a nun and within a very short time she became an Arahant. 

                  Some monks wondered how it was possible to attain the Awakenment after hearing just few words of the Dharma? The Buddha told them by this verse that one verse of the Dharma is better the hundreds of meaningless sentences.

.. [DLMBSFn-V103] (DLMBS Commentary V103) The story for this verse is the same as for the previous one. 

                  The highest battle does not take place on the battlefield, or in the political or academic arena, but only in our own minds. The victor of the highest battle is not somebody who conquers millions of enemies, who wins over his opponents, but a person who conquers the most difficult thing - his own mind. In other words, only an Arahant can be truly called a victor, because he won the final battle and he does not have to "fight" any more.

.. [DLMBSFn-V104] (DLMBS Commentary V104) A certain Brahmin once approached the Buddha and told him, "Venerable Sir, although you know all the beneficial practices, still I think you do not know the unbeneficial practices." The Buddha told him that he knew both beneficial and unbeneficial practices. He then proceeded to enumerate six unbeneficial practices that will cause loss of wealth. They are: sleeping until sunrise, idleness and laziness, cruelty, indulgence in intoxicating drinks that cause negligence and unclear mind, wandering alone in the city during night hours and sexual misconduct.

                  Then the Buddha asked the Brahmin how he made his living. The Brahmin told him that he earned his living by gambling, by playing dice. The Buddha further asked if he won or lost. The Brahmin replied that sometimes he won and sometimes he lost. The Buddha told him that to win in a game of dice couldn't be compared with winning over one's own mind, over one's ignorance and mental defilements.

.. [DLMBSFn-V105] (DLMBS Commentary V105) The story for this verse is identical to the one for the previous verse (see DhP 104). 

                  The final victory in the highest battle with the mind is the attainment of Arahantship. When we achieve this victory, nothing in the world can "undo" it. Nobody can defeat us any more. No gods, not even Mara, the Evil One can do anything. We reach the deliverance and are free from the cycle of rebirth, from suffering and pain.

.. [DLMBSFn-V106] (DLMBS Commentary V106) Venerable Sāriputta once asked his uncle if he was doing any good deeds. His uncle (who was a Brahmin) replied that every month he was making offerings to ascetics, hoping to be reborn in the heavenly world in the future existence. Sāriputta assured him that the ascetics did not really know the way to the heavenly world. He then took him to the Buddha who explained the Dharma to him and added that to pay respects to an Arahant is far better than to make offerings to somebody who is not really worth it.

.. [DLMBSFn-V107] (DLMBS Commentary V107) Venerable Sāriputta once asked his cousin if he was following any beneficial religious practices. His cousin told him that he sacrifices one goat every month in the fire and thus he will reach a heavenly world in his next existence. Sāriputta explained to him, that this was not the way to the heavenly world and took him to see the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha taught him the Dharma and further explained to him that to pay respects to an Arahant is far better than to sacrifice to the fire for hundred years. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V108] (DLMBS Commentary V108) Venerable Sāriputta once asked his friend, if he was following any beneficial religious practices. His friend, a Brahmin, told him that he was giving many sacrificial offerings and as a result of this he hopes to reach a heavenly world in his future existence. Sāriputta explained to him that in this way he would certainly not reach any heavenly world. 

                  He then took his friend to the Buddha who taught him the Dharma and told him that giving sacrificial offerings every day does not count one fourth of showing respect to the Arahants.

.. [DLMBSFn-V109] (DLMBS Commentary V109) Once there were two ascetics living together and practicing austerities. Later one of them returned to the lay life and got married. When a son was born to him and his wife, they took the boy to see the other ascetic. He said, "May you live long!" to the parents, but he said nothing to the child. The parents were surprised and asked him why did he do that. The ascetic said that he could see with his powers that the boy would die after seven more days. He sent them to see the Buddha, who could know how to prevent his death. 

                  When they got to the presence of the Buddha, he again said, "May you live long!" only to the parents and nothing to their son. In order to prevent his death, he told his parents to build a pavilion at their house and put the child on a couch inside it. He then sent some monks over to chant texts for protection. Many gods and other celestial beings came to the pavilion and were in attendance. On the seventh day, the Buddha himself arrived. Then an evil demon came to the pavilion and stood by the entrance. He waited for an opportunity to attack the boy. But as there were so many powerful beings around, he could not get near him. The chanting continued through the whole night, and in the morning the demon had to leave. The young child was saved. He then paid his respects to the Buddha who then told him, "May you live long!" The Buddha then told the parents that their child would live a very long life. 

                  Many years passed and the boy grew up. Once he came to see the Buddha and asked him how to gain longevity. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that those who respect people of virtuous character and who pay homage to those worth paying homage, not only will gain longevity, but also beauty, happiness and strength.

.. [DLMBSFn-V110] (DLMBS Commentary V110) A group of monks took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to a forest village to practice. There were robbers in the jungle around the village. They wanted to make a human sacrifice and they decided to offer one of the monks to the spirits of the forest. They went to the monastery and told the monks to select one of them who would follow them to the jungle and be sacrificed. All of the monks volunteered. There was a young novice with them, named Samkicca. Although he was very young, he was already an Arahant. He told the monks that Venerable Sariputta sent him to that place with the task to be the one to go with the robbers. Although the other monks did not like it a lot, still they trusted in Sariputta's judgment and so let Samkicca go. 

                  The bloody sacrifice was prepared deep in the jungle and the leader of the robbers took a sword and wanted to cut the young novice's head. At that time, Samkicca was in deep meditation and the sword did not cut him, but just curled up. The robber took another sword and hit again - only to find that the sword has bent upward. Samkicca was still unharmed. The robbers were terrified; all of them knelt down at the novice's feet and asked for forgiveness. They also asked his permission to become monks. He complied with this request and returned to the monastery with the new monks. 

                  Everybody was very happy that Samkicca was unharmed and that he managed to bring the robbers into the Sangha. They all left for Sāvatthi to pay homage to the Buddha and Venerable Sariputta. The Buddha then admonished them with this verse, saying that it is better to live just for one day, but virtuously and in meditation, than to live a very long life, but immorally and without any self-control.

.. [DLMBSFn-V111] (DLMBS Commentary V111) Venerable Kondañña once took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to practice to the forest. Soon he attained Awakenment. He was on his way back to the monastery and had to spend the night on the way. He sat by the road on a piece of rock and rested, in the deep meditation. 

                  That night some robbers stole many thing in a village and came to the same place where Kondañña was sitting. They mistook him for a tree and put their loot all over and around his body. Then they fell asleep. 

                  In the morning they realized that he was a living being and became frightened, because they though he was a ghost. Kondañña told them that he was only a monk. The robbers were very impressed by him. They paid homage to him and asked him to allow them to become monks themselves. Kondañña ordained them and together they returned to the monastery to see the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha spoke to them this verse, saying that it was better to live just one single day, meditating and cultivating wisdom, than a hundred years without any self-control and totally devoid of any wisdom.

.. [DLMBSFn-V112] (DLMBS Commentary V112) There was a certain monk named Sappadāsa, who was not happy with his life in the monastery. Although he tried his best, he could not attain Awakenment therefore he felt he was unable to do it and wanted to return to the worldly life. But he thought that would be very humiliating for him to do so. He contemplated his options and at the end he decided to commit suicide. He tried to put his hand into a pot with snakes but the snakes would not bite him. So he took a razor and wanted to cut his throat. He put the razor on his throat, but as he was about to cut himself, he reflected on his life as a monk. He realized that he had led a pure life, full of morality and spirituality. He became full of satisfaction and happiness. Then he detached himself from these feelings and reached Awakenment instantly. 

                  The other monks asked him what happened to him and he told them his story. They went to ask the Buddha if it was possible for someone to attain Arahantship while attempting suicide. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that indeed it was possible. He added that in reaching the Awakenment, time and space is not really relevant. It is possible to reach it while walking, before one's foot touches the ground.

.. [DLMBSFn-V113] (DLMBS Commentary V113) In Sāvatthi there lived a wealthy man. He had a daughter named Paṭācārā. She was very beautiful and was guarded by her parents when she grew up. But she fell in love with her young servant and ran away with him. They settled in a small village far away from her former home. When she became pregnant, she wanted to go back to her parents' house to deliver the baby there. Her husband was afraid that they would punish him, so he refused to go. But Paṭācārā really wanted to go, so she set out for home while he was away. Her husband hurried after her and caught her on the way. She delivered the baby right there and returned home with him. 

                  After some time, she became pregnant again. Again she requested they return back to Sāvatthi, again her husband refused. As before, she ran away, taking her first born with her. Her husband again found her and wanted to take her back home. At that time, she was about to deliver the baby. So he went away to search for a good place. While he was clearing some piece of land, a snake bit him and he died. Paṭācārā delivered the baby and in the morning she searched for her husband only to find him dead. She was very upset and blamed herself for his death. With both her children she continued to Sāvatthi. 

                  She came to a river, which was full and flooded, because it was raining. She was unable to carry both of her children at the same time. So she left the older boy at the bank and crossed the river with her newborn. She left him on the other side and went back to get her older child. While she was in the middle, a hawk attacked her newborn baby. She tried to frighten him away and shouted, but it carried the baby with it. The elder child heard his mother shouting and thought she was calling for him. So he tried to cross the river, only to be carried away by the strong current. 

                  Grief-stricken and crying she continued to Sāvatthi. At the outskirts of the city she asked a passer-by about her family. The man told her, that there was a terrible storm last night, her parents' house had fallen down, and both her parents and her brother died. So Paṭācārā lost all her family. On hearing this last piece of news she went completely crazy. Her clothes had fallen of her, but she did not notice and roamed through the streets of Sāvatthi. 

                  After a time she reached the Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was staying at that time. People did not want to allow her to enter, but the Buddha told them to let her come in. When Paṭācārā got to the Buddha, he told her to calm down and exercise some self-control. She then realized she was naked and covered herself with a piece of cloth. She told the Buddha her story. 

                  The Buddha then preached the Dharma to her, telling her that the number of lives when she lost her relatives and cried, was innumerable. At the end of the discourse Paṭācārā reached a first degree of Awakenment. 

                  She became a nun. Once she was washing her feet in the evening. She poured water from the pot, it flowed a short distance and disappeared in the ground. She poured the second time and water flowed little bit farther. When she poured water for the third time, it flowed farthest. She stood there contemplating that all things rise and fall, are born and die, some for a short time, some for longer. The Buddha saw her thoughts and told her this verse, saying that it was better to live shortly and understand this law than to live for hundred years and not to see it. Paṭācārā understood and attained Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V114] (DLMBS Commentary V114) In Sāvatthi there lived a young woman Kisā Gotami. She married a wealthy young man, became pregnant and delivered a baby. But the baby died shortly after he was born. Kisā Gotami was grieving so much that she went all around the city, carrying her dead baby, and asking if somebody knew a cure that would bring him back to life. One of those people sent her to the Buddha, thinking that maybe he could help her in some way. 

                  The Buddha told her that indeed he knew a cure. He requested one mustard seed from a house where nobody has died. Kisā Gotami thought it to be an easy task. Full of joy she began running from house to house asking if somebody died there. But she soon found out that there was death in every household in Sāvatthi and she was not the only one who lost somebody. She realized that everybody has to die and was no longer attached to her dead baby. Kisā Gotami buried her son and went back to the monastery, where she requested to be permitted to become a nun. 

                  The Buddha sent her to the community of the nuns and she was ordained. She was very diligent, always meditating and purifying her mind. 

                  One evening she was lightning oil lamps. She lighted them and kept looking at the flames. She soon realized that some flames were burning constantly, but other flickered out. She contemplated that it is exactly same with living beings: some flare up but others flicker out - only the Arahants can be seen no more. 

                  The Buddha saw her thoughts and told her this verse, saying that it is better to live just for one day and see the deathless state (Nirvana) than to live for hundred years without seeing it. After hearing the verse, Kisā Gotami attained Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V115] (DLMBS Commentary V115) In Sāvatthi there lived a husband and wife. They had many children and when they grew up, they got married and lived a nice life. The husband then died and the wife, Bahu Puttika, kept all the property to herself. The children asked her many timed to give them their inheritance and promised to look after her well. So at the end she agreed and divided up everything to her children and left nothing for herself. 

                  She went to stay with her eldest son. But after few days his wife started complaining that she did not give them two shares so how she dares to come to stay with them. Bahu Puttika went to the second son, where the same happened. So she went from one child to another but she was not welcome anywhere. 

                  She realized that nobody would give her proper care, so she decided to become a nun. Now because she left the home very old, she knew she did not have much time. Therefore she was extremely diligent and practiced meditation with a strong energy. The Buddha saw her effort and praised her with this verse, saying that it was better to live just for a short time but be able to realize the Dharma. A life, which lasts for many years, but is without understanding the Law, is useless. After hearing the verse, Bahu Puttika attained Awakenment.

.. [NāradaFn09-01] (Ven. Nārada 09-01) There should be no delay in doing good deeds. One must avail oneself of every opportunity to do good. Such good actions redound to one's eternal happiness. Every effort also should be made to control the mind as it is prone to evil. The impure mind rejoices in evil thoughts.

.. [NāradaFn09-02] (Ven. Nārada 09-02) Pāpa, evil, is that which defiles one's mind. It is that which leads to woeful states. "Sin", purely a Christian term is not a good English equivalent for pāpa. What is associated with the three immoral roots such as lust (rāga), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha) is evil. There are ten kinds of evil. They are killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct (which are committed by deed); lying, slandering, harsh speech, and frivolous talk (which are committed by word); and covetousness, ill-will, and false views (which are committed by mind).

.. [NāradaFn09-03] (Ven. Nārada 09-03) Puñña, merit is that which cleanses the mind. Kusala is another term for puñña. There are ten kinds of meritorious deeds. See notes on vv. 42, 43.

.. [NāradaFn09-04] (Ven. Nārada 09-04) A wicked person may lead a prosperous life as the result of his past good deeds. He will experience happiness owing to the potentiality of his past good over the present evil, a seeming injustice which often prevails in this world. When once, according to the inexorable law of kamma, his evil actions fructify, then he perceives the painful effects of his wickedness.

.. [NāradaFn09-05] (Ven. Nārada 09-05) A virtuous person, as often happens, may meet with adversity owing to the potentiality of his past evil actions over his present good acts. He is convinced of the efficacy of his present good deeds only when, at the opportune moment, they fructify, giving him abundant bliss. The fact that at times the wicked are prosperous and the virtuous are unfortunate is itself strong evidence in support of the belief in kamma and rebirth.

.. [NāradaFn09-06] (Ven. Nārada 09-06) Māppamaññetha in most texts.

.. [NāradaFn09-07] (Ven. Nārada 09-07) That is, for one who has no evil intention.

.. [NāradaFn09-08] (Ven. Nārada 09-08) According to Buddhism there are four kinds of birth - namely: egg-born (aṇóaja), womb-born (jalābuja), moisture-born (saṃsedaja) and spontaneous birth (opapātika).

.. [NāradaFn09-09] (Ven. Nārada 09-09) Niraya = ni + aya = devoid of happiness. There are four kinds of niraya - namely: woeful state (apāya), the animal kingdom (tiracchānayoni), the plane of Petas (petayoni) and the plane of Asura-demons (asurayoni).

                    None of these states is eternal. According to their evil kamma beings may be born in such woeful states. Departing from those states they may be born in blissful states according to their past good kamma.

.. [NāradaFn09-10] (Ven. Nārada 09-10) Sagga = su + agga = full of happiness. In the sense-sphere (kāmaloka) the human plane and the six celestial planes are regarded as blissful states. They too are not eternal.

.. [NāradaFn09-11] (Ven. Nārada 09-11) Arahants, after death, are not born any more, but attain Parinibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn09-12] (Ven. Nārada 09-12) The Buddhist law of moral causation cannot be bribed, nor can one escape the evil consequences of kamma by seeking refuge in any place on earth. No god, not even a Buddha, can intervene in the operation of kamma.

.. [ThaniSFn-V121-122] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 121-122) "('It won't amount to much')": reading na mattam agamissati with the Thai edition. Other editions read, na mantam agamissati, "It won't come to me."

.. [ThaniSFn-V126] (Ven. Thanissaro V.126) Heaven and hell, in the Buddhist view of the cosmos, are not eternal states. One may be reborn on one of the various levels of heaven or hell as the result of one's kamma on the human plane, and then leave that level when that particular store of kamma wears out.

.. [DLMBSFn-V116] (DLMBS Commentary V116) In Sāvatthi there lived a poor brahmin with his wife. They had only one piece of outer garment, so only one of them could go out at one time. They were lay disciple of the Buddha and wanted to hear as many of his discourses as possible. So the brahmin would go to the monastery at night and his wife during the day. Once the brahmin was listening to the Buddha and he felt very strong wish to perform meritorious deeds. He wanted to offer his only piece of cloth to the Buddha. But he realized that he and his wife would have nothing to wear then. So his mind wavered and he hesitated. Finally during the last hours of the night he offered his cloth to the Buddha, saying, "I win!" 

                  The king of Kosala, Pasenadi, was also present, and when he heard the brahmin he sent messengers to ask why he shouted, "I win!" When he learned the brahmin's story, he was very much impressed and decided to give him a reward. He ordered the brahmin be offered a new piece of cloth. The brahmin gave that piece also to the Buddha. The king gave him two pieces of cloth, which were again offered to the Buddha. Pasenadi again doubled the number of clothes; the brahmin again gave them to the Buddha. So at the end the king gave him thirty-two pieces of cloth, the brahmin kept one for himself, one for his wife, and remaining thirty he again offered to the Buddha. 

                  The king was so much impressed that he decided to reward the brahmin further. He gave him two pieces of very expensive velvet cloth. The brahmin made two canopies out of them, kept one for himself and his wife and the second one he offered to the Buddha. The king then saw the canopy in the monastery and realized that the brahmin has done a meritorious deed again. So he decided to reward him even more. 

                  Some monks wondered how it was possible that in this case a good deed brings good results so quickly. The Buddha replied, that had the brahmin offered his garment immediately when the idea occurred to him, his reward would have been much greater. He then added this verse, saying that if one wants to perform meritorious deeds, one should do so quickly, without hesitation. If one thinks about it too long, then maybe it becomes impossible to do anything at all, because the mind delights in evil.

.. [DLMBSFn-V117] (DLMBS Commentary V117) There was a monk named Seyyasaka. He was not satisfied with his life as a monk. He had a habit of masturbating. When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished the monk for giving in to his desire for sensual pleasures. He made a new rule for the community of monks and nuns to abstain from such acts. He then added this verse, saying that one should not perform evil again and again, because such behavior leads to much suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V118] (DLMBS Commentary V118) Venerable Mahākassapa once stayed in a cave, practicing meditation for seven days. When he arose from his meditation he wanted to give somebody a chance to gain merit by offering him food. He saw a young girl cooking meal. So he stood by her door looking for almsfood. She saw him and happily offered him some food, wishing that the merit gained offering might help her to realize the truth. 

                  After some time she was bitten by a snake and died. She was reborn as a goddess in Tavatimsa heaven. 

                  She understood that she was reborn there only because of the merit gained by offering almsfood to Kassapa. She wished to continue doing good deeds. So every morning she would come to the monastery, sweep the floor and fill the water-pots. At first Kassapa thought that some diligent young novice was doing this service, but later he found out that a goddess performed them all. He advised her not to come to the monastery too often, because people might start talking, if they saw her often there. She was quite upset and begged him not to destroy her chances for gaining more merit. 

                  The Buddha heard her and supported Kassapa's opinion. He told her that although performing good deeds was very pleasant, she should not continue coming to the monastery every day.

.. [DLMBSFn-V119] (DLMBS Commentary V119) One of the most famous benefactors of the Buddha was Anāthapindika from the city of Sāvatthi. He built the Jetavana monastery and regularly donated food and other requisites to the community of the Buddha's followers. By doing so, he gave away most of his wealth and became poor. The guardian spirit of his house came to him and told him to stop donating for some time, make money, become rich again, and then continue giving. Anāthapindika told the spirit to leave his house for saying such things.

                  The guardian spirit went to see Sakka, the king of the gods, and asked him what should he do to get pardon from Anāthapindika. Sakka told him that there was some money Anāthapindika loaned to others and did not collect it back yet. He also pointed to the guardian spirit some wealth buried by Anāthapindika's ancestors. The spirit collected all those riches and brought them to Anāthapindika’s house. 

                  Anāthapindika then permitted the spirit to enter the house and continue living there. The Buddha learned about this story and told them these two verses (DhP 119 and 120). Even though the good person can come to misfortune sometimes, the results of his good deeds will come sure enough - and so will the results of evil deeds of a bad person, even though for some time he might enjoy luck and happiness.

.. [DLMBSFn-V120] (DLMBS Commentary V120) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verse. 

                  Sometimes it seems that people, who are committing evil deeds are lucky and enjoy happy life, whereas those, who are good and perform only meritorious deeds suffer the most. But at the end, the results of the deeds will ripe and when the time comes to that, the evildoer will finally receive the fruit of his evil deeds and the good person will be able to see the results of his beneficial actions.

.. [DLMBSFn-V121] (DLMBS Commentary V121) A certain monk would use a piece of furniture for some time and then leave it outside in the monastery yard, exposing it to sun and rain. Other monks tried to admonish him, but he always said only that it is not his intention to destroy the things, and that no serious harm was actually done. 

                  When the Buddha found out about this, he sent for the monk and told him this verse, saying that one should not disregard evil, however small, because a hundred small evils is actually equal to one big evil. Moreover, if one gets used to small evils, a bad habit is established, and a great evil then does not seem so terrible to such a person. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V122] (DLMBS Commentary V122) A certain man from the city of Sāvatthi wanted to give in charity. Especially he wanted to get others to do so. He invited the Buddha with monks for meal the next day. He went around his neighbors and asked them to contribute if they want to participate in the almsgiving. One rich man thought that this man does not have enough money to do it himself and he was unhappy about this. So he contributed only a little amount of food. His contribution was kept separately and was not put together with the food that others contributed. The rich man thought that the man wanted others to know, that he, the rich man, has given only such a little amount. So the next day he sent a servant over to the house, where the alms were being given, and told him to observe everything. 

                  The servant told the rich man, that his food was distributed in very small amounts into everything. This was done, so that the rich man would gain a lot of merit. But he did not understand it and the next day he went to the man's house, intending to kill him if he dared to reveal that he offered so little. 

                  But the man told him the true reason of his action. The rich man realized his evil thoughts and apologized to the man. The Buddha heard this and told the rich man this verse, saying that we should not disregard good deeds, even if they seem small. Someday, doing of good deeds will become a habit, and thus we can perform a big good deed.

.. [DLMBSFn-V123] (DLMBS Commentary V123) In Sāvatthi there lived a rich merchant named Mahā Dhana. A group of robbers wanted to rob him. Mahā Dhana decided to make a journey with a lot of valuable merchandise. He invited some monks who wanted to go on the same journey to go with him. The robbers hid themselves in a forest and waited for Mahā Dhana's caravan. But Mahā Dhana found out about their plan and decided to stop just in front of the forest and wait for the robbers to leave. When they did not do so, Mahā Dhana decided to go back home. The robbers found out and planned to attack him on the return journey. Some people told Mahā Dhana about this and so he stopped in the village and stayed there for some time. 

                  The monks returned back to Sāvatthi and told the Buddha what happened. Buddha told them this verse, saying, that a merchant is wise to keep away from the journey full of robbers. Also one who wants to live better keep away from poison. And those, who want to attain Awakenment, should avoid evil.

.. [DLMBSFn-V124] (DLMBS Commentary V124) A daughter of a rich family once lived in Rājagaha. She was very wise and understood the Dharma - she had attained the first stage of Awakenment. Once she met a hunter named Kukkuṭa Mitta and they fell in love. They got married and had seven children. After many years, all the children got themselves married. 

                  Once the Buddha walked past one of Kukkuṭa Mitta's traps and he sat under a tree not far away and rested. Kukkuṭa Mitta came, saw the footsteps, but he saw no animal. So he thought that somebody stole his animal from the trap. Seeing the Buddha close, he took him to be that person. He became very angry and wanted to kill the Buddha. He took his bow and arrow, but as he was about to shoot he became immobilized just like a statue. His children came next and saw what happened to their father. They too took bows and arrows and tried to shoot the Buddha, only to become "statues" themselves. When they did not return in time, the hunter's wife went to the forest to look for them. When she saw what happened, she shouted to them, "Don't kill my father!" 

                  The hunter and his children thought that the Buddha was her real father and they ceased hating him. Immediately they were able to move again. The woman told them to put down their bows and arrows and when they did so, the Buddha expounded the Dharma. At the end of the discourse, all of them also attained the first stage of Awakenment. 

                  The Buddha went back to the monastery and told the monks the story. Some monks wondered how the woman, having already reached the first stage of Awakenment, could help her husband to take lives of animals. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that if one has no intention to commit evil, no bad karma is actually created.

.. [DLMBSFn-V125] (DLMBS Commentary V125) A hunter named Koka was leaving the city to hunt with his dogs. He met a monk who was entering the city to obtain some almsfood. The hunter took this for a bad sign and thought that that day he wouldn’t catch any animal. And that also happened - he did not get anything. Angry he went back home. On entering the city he met the same monk who obtained his food and was returning to the monastery. The hunter became so angry that he sent his dogs to kill the monk. But he climbed a tree and the dogs were unable to reach him. The hunter took an arrow and pricked the monk's feet with it. The monk was in pain and his robe fell down. 

                  It just happened that the hunter was standing directly bellow. The robe fell onto him. His dogs thought that the monk fell down and attacked him. The monk threw some branches down and only then the dogs realized that they attacked their own master and ran away. The monk climbed down and found out that the hunter was already dead. 

                  When he returned to the monastery, he went to see the Buddha, because he felt responsible for the hunter's death. But the Buddha told him that he was not responsible at all. Only hunter himself and his foolish actions caused him the untimely death. The Buddha then added this verse, saying that whoever wants to harm an innocent, calls evil on himself. Just like trying to throw dust against the wind - it will just come back and fall upon the very person who threw it.

.. [DLMBSFn-V126] (DLMBS Commentary V126) In the city of Sāvatthi once lived a gem polisher. He has been giving almsfood to a certain monk for the last twelve years. One day, the gem polisher was carrying a piece of meat when a messenger for the king arrived, giving him a piece of gem that the king wanted to be cut and polished. The gem polisher took the gem with his hands bloody from the meat, put it on the table and went to wash his hands.

                  The family had a pet bird. When it saw the gem covered with blood, it took it for a piece of meat and ate it. When the gem polisher returned, he did not see the gem anywhere. He asked everybody, but nobody knew anything. At the end he also asked the monk, who was also present. The monk replied that he did not take the gem.

                  The gem polisher was convinced, that the monk was lying and decided to inflict torture on him. Even though his wife discouraged him from this action, saying that this monk was an Arahant and their teacher for so many years, the gem polisher paid no attention. He tied the monk up and beat him with a stick.

                  The monk started to bleed all over his body and the bird came over again, drawn by the blood. The gem polisher was angry and kicked the bird, killing it instantly. Only then did the monk reveal that the bird ate the gem. The gem polisher cut the bird open and indeed found the gem inside.

                  Immediately he untied the monk and asked for forgiveness. The monk replied that he feels no hatred towards him and even agreed to continue coming to his house for almsfood. Only after this he would not enter the house - just stay by the door.

                  Soon after, the monk died from his injuries and reached the final Nirvana. The bird was born as the gem polisher's son. When the gem polisher died he was born in hell and his wife in heaven, because she spoke against beating of the innocent monk.

.. [DLMBSFn-V127] (DLMBS Commentary V127) Three groups of monks were traveling from far away to see the Buddha. On the way strange things happened to them. 

                  The first group stayed in a village on their way. Some people were cooking meal when their hut caught fire and burned. A crow was flying over the place, got caught in the fire and died. 

                  When they met the Buddha, he told them this story. One farmer had a very lazy ox. It would not work, it would only lie down, eat and sleep. The farmer once got so angry, that he put a rope around the neck of the animal and set fire to it. So the ox died. Because of this, the farmer was reborn as a crow and died in the fire himself. 

                  The second group took a boat. In the middle of the ocean the ship would not suddenly move. They searched for the unlucky person, who is causing this to happen. Three times lots were drawn and three times it fell on the captain's wife. So at the end they tied a pot of sand to her neck and drowned her. The ship then continued to the port safely and the monks got to see the Buddha. 

                  He told them, that once there was a woman who had a pet dog. The dog would follow her everywhere; it just would not stay away even for a moment. Some people were making fun of her. So she felt ashamed, tied a pot of sand around the dog's neck and drowned it. Because of this, she was reborn as that unlucky woman who was drowned by other people. 

                  The third group of seven monks stayed in a cave overnight. In the middle of the night a big rock fell from the mountain above and blocked the entrance into the cave. People discovered them in the morning and tried to move the rock, but they were unable to do it. Only on the seventh day they moved the rock away and the monks were free. 

                  To them the Buddha related the story of seven cowherds who chased an iguana into a mound and for fun closed all the entrances. They let the iguana out only after seven days. So in this life they were reborn as the seven monks who were trapped in the cave for a week. 

                  At the end the Buddha said this verse, saying that one can never escape the consequences of evil deeds. They will find us anywhere, nobody can hide from them, even in the air, ocean or in a cave - the consequences will befall us surely. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V128] (DLMBS Commentary V128) Buddha had also some enemies. One of them was his own cousin Devadatta who wanted to take the Buddha's place in the Community. Devadatta's father was king Suppabuddha. He was also an enemy of the Buddha, because the Buddha married Suppabuddha's daughter, Yasodhara, and later left her and became a monk. 

                  When the Buddha came for almsfood to his place, the king got drunk and blocked the way. He refused to make way for the Buddha. The Buddha turned around and went back, saying to the monks that the king make a bad karma by refusing to make way for a Buddha and would have to face the consequences very soon. 

                  Suppabuddha wanted to prove the Buddha wrong, so he paid special attention to his deeds and also instructed his servants to protect him very carefully. But on the seventh day he heard his horse neighing loudly and kicking about. He wanted to handle the horse and went down to the stable. He fell down the stairs and died immediately. 

                  The Buddha remarked that one can not escape death no matter how one tries, no matter where on hides.

.. [NāradaFn10-01] (Ven. Nārada 10-01) Na haneyya na ghātaye = na pahareyya na paharāpeyya (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn10-09] (Ven. Nārada 10-09) Gymnosophism is still practised in India. External dirtiness is regarded by some as a mark of saintliness. The Buddha denounces strict asceticism confined to such externals. The members of His celibate Order follow the middle path, avoiding the extremes of self-mortification and self-indulgence. Simplicity, humility, and poverty should be the chief characteristics of bhikkhus as much as cleanliness.

.. [NāradaFn10-19] (Ven. Nārada 10-19) Mrs. Rhys Davids: "Walking in God", a very misleading phrase, totally foreign to Buddhism. The commentarial explanation is seññhacariya - highest conduct.

.. [NāradaFn10-23] (Ven. Nārada 10-23) Bhikkhu, because he has destroyed passions.

.. [NāradaFn10-24] (Ven. Nārada 10-24) A gaily decked minister, stricken with grief, listened to the Buddha, seated on an elephant. On hearing the discourse, he realized Arahantship. Simultaneous with his realization his death occurred. The Buddha then advised his followers to pay him the respect due to an Arahant. When the bhikkhus questioned him how the minister could have attained Arahantship in such elegant dress the Buddha uttered this verse to show that purity comes from within and not from without. In striking contrast to the former this verse clearly indicates the Buddhist view of a holy person. It is not the apparel that counts but internal purity.

.. [NāradaFn10-25] (Ven. Nārada 10-25) A self-respecting bhikkhu or layman, when obsessed with evil thoughts, tries to eradicate them there and then. This verse indicates that such persons are rare.

.. [NāradaFn10-26] (Ven. Nārada 10-26) Vijjācaraṇa. Eight kinds of Knowledge and fifteen kinds of Conduct.

                    The eight kinds of Knowledge are: (1) Psychic Powers (iddhividha), (2) Divine Ear (dibba-sota), (3) Penetration of the minds of others (ceto-pariya-ñāṇa), (4) Divine Eye (dibba-cakkhu), (5) Remembrance of former births (pubbe-nivāsanussati), (6) Extinction of corruptions (āsavakkhaya), (7) Insight (vipassanā) and (8) Creation of mental images (manomayiddhi).

                    The fifteen kinds of Conduct are:- Moral restraint, sense-restraint, moderation in eating, wakefulness, faith, moral shame, moral dread, great learning, energy, mindfulness, wisdom and the four Jhānas.

.. [NāradaFn10-27] (Ven. Nārada 10-27) Cf. v. 80.

.. [ThaniSFn-V143] (Ven. Thanissaro V.143) Some translators have proposed that the verb apabodheti, here translated as "awakens" should be changed to appam bodheti, "to think little of." This, however, goes against the sense of the verse and of a recurrent image in the Canon, that the better-bred the horse, the more sensitive it is even to the idea of the whip, to say nothing of the whip itself. See, for example, A 4.113.

                     The question raised in this verse is answered in SN 1.18:

                     ::

                      Those restrained by conscience
                       are rare —
                      those who go through life
                       always mindful.
                      Having reached the end
                       of suffering & stress,
                      they go through what is uneven
                          evenly;
                       go through what is out-of-tune
                          in tune.

.. [VaradoFn-V129] (Ven. Varado V. 129) Verse 129: ghataye can mean either 'kill' or 'cause to be killed'. See PED under ghateti and hanati. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V129] (DLMBS Commentary V129) One group of monks was cleaning a certain building in the Jetavana monastery. They intended to stay there. When they were in the middle of cleaning, another group of monks arrived there and wanted them to give the building over to them. They felt that as they were more senior monks, they should have the right to choose. 

                  But the first group did not agree to that and insisted on keeping the building to themselves. The monks from the second group beat them up till the monks cried in pain. 

                  When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished the second group of monks harshly for inflicting pain on their fellow monks. He told them this verse, saying that violence is not a solution. He moreover laid down a new rule for the monks to abstain from hurting others.

.. [DLMBSFn-V130] (DLMBS Commentary V130) In the last verse (see DhP 129) we saw monks beating each other because of a building. But the question of the building arose again. The second group of monks still intended to take it for themselves and again, the first group did not agree to that. 

                  As a new rule was established, the monks from the second group did not physically attack the first group, but they made threatening gestures to them. The monks from the first group were frightened and cried out. 

                  The Buddha again admonished the second group of monks, telling them this verse. And he also set another rule, that monks should not make threatening gestures to each other.

.. [DLMBSFn-V131] (DLMBS Commentary V131) The Buddha once saw a group of young men from Sāvatthi beating a snake with sticks. He asked why were they doing such thing. The youths answered that they were afraid of being bitten by the snake therefore they beat it. The Buddha told them this verse, saying that if we do not wish to be harm by some being the first step is not to harm it ourselves. 

                  The young men attained the first stage of Awakenment after hearing this discourse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V132] (DLMBS Commentary V132) The story for this verse is identical with that to the previous one (DhP 131). 

                  To abstain from violence is one of the basic principles of the Buddha's teaching. Especially in the case of the young men hurting the snake it can be seen that to hurt somebody first to stop him from hurting me is not a good idea. 

                  We should practice the universal loving kindness, known as mettā and try to radiate it to all the directions. When faced with danger, we should radiate this mettā towards the being that intends or might intend to hurt us.

.. [DLMBSFn-V133] (DLMBS Commentary V133) There was a monk named Kundadhāna. From the day he became a monk, others saw a female form always following him everywhere. But he himself did not see anything. 

                  Once he went out on to gather alms food and people offered him two portions of food, saying that one was for him and the other for his friend. Then they reported to the king that one of the monks seems to have a girlfriend. The king Pasenadi started to investigate the matter. 

                  When the king was in the room with the monk, the female form was not present. The monk himself also professed his innocence. When the king sent him out of the room, the female form suddenly appeared close to him. The king realized that the woman was not real and the monk was really innocent. So he invited him for almsfood. 

                  The other monks were not happy and started to scold Kundadhāna, saying that in fact he had a girlfriend somewhere and that he had no morals. Kundadhāna got angry and retorted with his own accusations. 

                  The Buddha then admonished him and told him this verse. He further explained, that in his previous life Kundadhāna was a deity who wanted to create discord between two monks who very good friends. He would assume the form of a woman and follow closely one of them, thus hoping to stop their friendship. For that deed a female form was now following him.

.. [DLMBSFn-V134] (DLMBS Commentary V134) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (see DhP 133). 

                  The vibrations in this verse point mainly to passion and hatred. If we do not have these feelings, then we are silent, just like a broken gong. It will not resonate when we try to hit it. In the same way, when we are devoid of passions and are "hit" by the objects that are usually causing them, we will not "resonate". That means, we are completely without passion, hatred and ignorance - and we have reached the goal, attained Nirvana and stopped all the suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V135] (DLMBS Commentary V135) A large group of women came to the Pubbārāma monastery to observe the precepts for one day. Visākhā, the woman who built that monastery, asked them for what purpose did they come to observe the precepts. Different women gave her different answers. 

                  Old women did so in order to have a good rebirth, middle aged women wanted to have peaceful and prosperous lives with their families, young women came in order to give birth to a son and unmarried girls wanted to find a good husband. 

                  Visākhā took them to see the Buddha. He told her this verse, saying that although we are all constantly driven by birth, old age and death, there are still so few people who realize this and strive for Awakenment and release from this never-ending cycle. Most people still pursue only earthly goals and do not care about overcoming them. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V136] (DLMBS Commentary V136) Venerable Moggallāna once went on an alms-round with Venerable Lakkhaṇa. On the way from a certain hill he smiled as if he saw something strange. When they were back at the monastery, Lakkhaṇa asked him about this incident. 

                  Moggallāna said that he saw a ghost in the form of a snake, being burned by flames. The Buddha told them that he also saw that particular ghost and revealed to them his story. 

                  A long time ago there was a thief who repeatedly burned a house of a certain man. Not satisfied with that he also set fire to a monastery, donated by that man. As a result of these deeds, he was reborn as that ghost-snake, burned by flames. 

                  At the end the Buddha added this verse, saying that even though a fool does not realize evilness of his actions, the consequences will certainly reach him.

.. [DLMBSFn-V137] (DLMBS Commentary V137) Some ascetics were planning to kill Venerable Moggallāna because they thought that the Buddha and his teaching would be hurt by this action. So they hired a group of killers who surrounded the cave where Moggallāna was staying. But he used his supernatural powers and escaped. The killers did not give up but were pursuing him around the clock. After three months Moggallāna realized that he had to get caught as a consequence of one bad deed he committed in one of his previous life. Although he was an Arahant and did not create any new karma, he was still reaping fruit of his actions before he reached the Awakenment. 

                  So he let himself to be caught and the killers beat him up. When they thought he was dead, they left him in a forest and went away. But Moggallāna was still alive, used his supernatural powers to revive himself for a short time and went to pay his respects to the Buddha. He told the Buddha what happened and the Buddha asked him to teach the Dharma to all the monks for one last time. Moggallāna did so and died soon after that. 

                  The king ordered an investigation, caught the killers and executed them. The monks asked the Buddha how was it possible that Moggallāna was killed like that. The Buddha told them a story from Moggallāna previous life. 

                  Once he was a son of blind parents. At the beginning he was a very good son, treating them well. But after he got married, his wife hated his parents and induced him to kill them. Moggallāna took his parents to the forest and beat them to death, while pretending that some robbers were actually killing them. For this deed he had to die himself in his very last existence at the end of killers, beaten up to death.

.. [DLMBSFn-V139] (DLMBS Commentary V139) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verses (DhP 137, DhP 138), the story of Moggallana's untimely death.

.. [DLMBSFn-V140] (DLMBS Commentary V140) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verses (DhP 137, DhP 138, DhP 139), the story of Moggallana's untimely death.

.. [DLMBSFn-V141] (DLMBS Commentary V141) In Sāvatthi there lived a rich man named Bahu Bhāṇḍika. When his wife died, he decided to become a monk. But first he built himself a monastery, brought many servants and provisions of food with him. So even as a monk he lived in comfort and had plenty of delicious food every day. 

                  When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished the monk, saying that his teaching is about simple life and asked why did he bring so much property with him. The monks became angry and took off his robe, asking the Buddha if this was the way he wanted him to live from now on. 

                  The Buddha again admonished him, "How come you have lost your sense of shame and fear of evil? Even in your former existence as a hungry ghost you had this sense, where did it go?" The monk realized his mistake and apologized for getting angry and taking off his clothes. 

                  The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that austerities and ascetic practices do not make a monk. Only when we discard ignorance can we be really free. 

                  At the end of this discourse, many monks present attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V142] (DLMBS Commentary V142) The king Pasenadi of Kosala once sent his minister Santati to deal with some rebellion in the border area. Santati suppressed it quickly and efficiently and the king was very pleased. He gave Santati many gifts, amongst others also a dancing girl to entertain him. The minister spent several days drinking and enjoying the young dancer.

                  On the last day, he went to the river to take a bath. On the way he met the Buddha and some monks. Even though he was drunk, he still bowed in respect. The Buddha remarked to Venerable Ānanda that Santati will reach the Awakenment the very same day and soon after that he will die. 

                  In the evening, the dancer again entertained Santati and his guests. While dancing, she died due to exhaustion. The minister was shocked and distressed. Immediately he went to the Buddha and begged for some words of solace. The Buddha told him to get rid of his cravings, not to let these feelings to enslave him. By getting rid of all the cravings, all the roots of evil will be destroyed and he will reach the Nirvana. 

                  After hearing this, Santati attained Awakenment. Realizing, that he was about to die, he thanked the Buddha for his help and told him that he was about to reach the final emancipation. Soon after that he passed away. 

                  Some monks were confused that Santati attained the Arahantship, although he was wearing beautiful dress and ornaments. They asked if he was a monk or a Brahmin. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that clothes and ornaments are not important. What counts is whether one has or has not freed oneself from ignorance and cravings.

.. [DLMBSFn-V143] (DLMBS Commentary V143) Venerable Ānanda once met a young beggar who was going around dressed in old rags and holding a begging plate. After meeting Ānanda, the man decided to become a monk. His name was Pilotika. 

                  When he became a monk, he put his old clothes and the plate under a certain tree. Sometimes he felt not satisfied with his life as a monk and he went back to the tree and contemplated going back to the layman's life. But when he realized how miserable were his days before he became a monk, he felt shame and returned to the monastery. 

                  This happened many times. Other monks asked him where was he going all the time. He told them he went to see his teacher. Pilotika considered his old clothes and the plate to be his teacher, because they taught him futility of the lay life many times. He started to practice earnestly and took his old clothes as a meditation subject. Soon he was able to reach Awakenment and therefore he stopped going to the tree. 

                  Other monks asked him again, why does not he go to see his teacher any more. Pilotika replied that he does not have need for a teacher any more, hinting that he was an Arahant. The monks went to see the Buddha and asked him if it was true, if Pilotika has really reached the goal. The Buddha replied in affirmative, saying that indeed Pilotika now has no need to see his "teacher" because he has nothing to learn from the old clothes anymore. He has realized the truth and became an Arahant. The Buddha further added this verse and the following one (DhP 144).

.. [DLMBSFn-V144] (DLMBS Commentary V144) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP 143). 

                  There is no reason to whip a good horse - it knows what to do and how to do it. In the same way there is no need to blame a good person, he is not acting in a way that has to be blamed. 

                  The good horse needs only to be touched by the whip and then it knows what to do. So it is with a good person. He is "touched" by the suffering and immediately starts to make effort to escape it forever.

.. [DLMBSFn-V145] (DLMBS Commentary V145) Venerable Sāriputta once had a very young novice. His name was Sukha. One day, he went with Sāriputta on his alms-round. He observed irrigators irrigating the fields, arrow-makers making their arrows and carpenters working with wood. He asked Venerable Sāriputta if those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever one wishes. Sāriputta replied that it is so. The young novice then thought, "If those things, which have no mind, could be guided to wherever one wishes, then why could not I master myself?"

                  He then asked permission from Sāriputta, returned to the monastery and diligently practiced. He was about to attain Arahantship, when Sāriputta returned and was going towards the novice's hut. The Buddha saw this and he also saw that the novice was just about to attain the goal, so he met Sāriputta outside and prevented him from going to the novice's hut by asking him various questions. The novice indeed attained Arahantship very soon and the Buddha explained that the reason, why he kept Sāriputta outside, was to enable the young novice to attain his goal without being interrupted.

.. [NāradaFn11-01] (Ven. Nārada 11-01) This world is perpetually consumed with the flames of passions. It is completely surrounded by the veil of ignorance. Being placed in such a world, the wise should try to seek the light of wisdom.

.. [NāradaFn11-02] (Ven. Nārada 11-02) As good and pleasant.

.. [NāradaFn11-03] (Ven. Nārada 11-03) The nine supramundane states are the four Paths, the four Fruits and Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn11-04] (Ven. Nārada 11-04) Such as the Buddhas.

.. [NāradaFn11-05] (Ven. Nārada 11-05) These two verses, the first paean of joy (udāna) uttered by the Buddha immediately after His Enlightenment, are not found elsewhere. As the Venerable Ananda heard them from the lips of the Buddha they have been inserted here.

                    Here the Buddha admits his past wanderings in existence which entails suffering, a fact which evidently proves the belief in rebirth. He was compelled to wander and consequently to suffer, as long as be could not discover the architect who built this house, the body. In His final birth He discovered by His own intuitive wisdom the elusive architect dwelling not outside but within the recesses of His own heart. The architect was Craving or Attachment (taṇhā), a self-created force a mental element latent in all. The discovery of the architect is the eradication of craving by attaining Arahantship which, in this utterance, is alluded to as the end of craving.

                    The rafters of this self-created house are the defilements (kilesa). The ridge-pole that supports the rafters is ignorance (avijjā), the root cause of all defilements. The shattering of the ridge-pole of ignorance by wisdom results in the complete demolition of the house. The ridge-pole and the rafters are the material with which the architect builds this undesired house. With their destruction the architect is deprived of the wherewithal to rebuild the house which is not wanted. With the demolition of the house the mind attains the unconditioned which is Nibbāna.

.. [BudRkFn-v153-154]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita vv. 153-154) According to the commentary, these verses are the Buddha's "Song of Victory," his first utterance after his Enlightenment. The house is individualized existence in samsara, the house-builder craving, the rafters the passions and the ridge-pole ignorance.

.. [ThaniSFn-V152] (Ven. Thanissaro V.152) Muscles: This is a translation of the Pali mansani, which is usually rendered in this verse as "flesh." However, because the Pali word is in the plural form, "muscles" seems more accurate — and more to the point.

.. [ThaniSFn-V153-154] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 153-154) DhpA: These verses were the Buddha's first utterance after his full Awakening. For some reason, they are not reported in any of the other canonical accounts of the events following on the Awakening.

                        DhpA: "House" = selfhood; house-builder = craving. "House" may also refer to the nine abodes of beings — the seven stations of consciousness and two spheres (see Khp 4 and DN 15).

                        The word anibbisam in 153 can be read either as the negative gerund of nibbisati ("earning, gaining a reward") or as the negative gerund of nivisati, altered to fit the meter, meaning "coming to a rest, settled, situated." Both readings make sense in the context of the verse, so the word is probably intended to have a double meaning: without reward, without rest.

.. [VaradoFn-V147]  (Ven. Varado V.147) Verse 147: "orifice-marked" (arukāyaṃ). PED: "a heap of sores", which seems euphemistic.

.. [DLMBSFn-V146] (DLMBS Commentary V146) Visākhā was one of the most famous female lay disciples. She was very devoted and generous. Once, some men from Sāvatthi asked Visākhā to be a companion to their wives, who were frivolous and liked to drink alcohol. Their husband hoped that Visākhā could have positive influence on them. 

                  Once, the group of women went to the garden. The wives secretly brought some liquor and got drunk. When Visākhā found out about it, she was angry and reprimanded them. 

                  At another occasion, the women wanted to go to the garden again. Visākhā refused, remembering what happened the last time. So they requested to go to the Jetavana monastery to pay respect to the Buddha. 

                  After arriving at the monastery, the ladies again got drunk from the liquor they brought secretly along. Māra further influenced their minds and the women started to behave shamelessly: they were dancing, singing and jumping about. 

                  When the Buddha saw this, he used his supernormal powers. He let the room get dark and illuminated the sky with rays of strong light. The women were frightened and awed at the same time. They got sober quickly. 

                  The Buddha admonished them for their behavior and for getting drunk. He told them that drinking alcohol brings pain and unhappiness, it clouds our minds and then we are more likely to get under influence of evil passions. 

                  At the end of the discourse, all the ladies were firmly established in the path and returned home mindfully and peacefully.

.. [DLMBSFn-V147] (DLMBS Commentary V147) In Rājagaha there lived a beautiful courtesan named Sirimā. She was a devoted disciple of the Buddha and used to offer almsfood to the monks every day. One monk mentioned to his friends how generous and beautiful she was, how delicious the food offered by her was. One young monk heard this and fell in love with Sirimā without even seeing her. 

                  The next day he joined the monks who went to her house. Although Sirimā was sick, she still paid her respects to the monks and gave them almsfood. After seeing her, the young monk desired her even more. 

                  But that night Sirimā died. The Buddha wanted to teach the young monk a lesson, so asked the king to keep the corpse for few days without burying it. On the fourth day the dead body was put to the cemetery ground. It was no longer beautiful, it was bloated, stinky and full of worms. The Buddha told the young monk if he wanted to go to see Sirimā. The monk has not heard about her death so he was very happy to agree. How terrible his shock was when they got to the cemetery and he saw Sirimā’s corpse! 

                  The Buddha then asked the king to announce, that anybody who paid one thousand coins, could spend the night with Sirimā. But nobody wanted to do so. The price went gradually down, until she was available for free. But even then there was nobody willing to spend the night with the corpse. 

                  The Buddha then told the monks to realize, that few days ago many men would willing to pay even more than one thousand for a night with the courtesan, but now nobody wants her even for free. He further spoke on the subject of non-attachment to the body. The young monk gained insight into the true nature of the body and his love for Sirimā disappeared.

.. [DLMBSFn-V148] (DLMBS Commentary V148) Uttarā was a very old nun - she was one hundred and twenty years old. But se was very generous and respectful. Many times she shared her almsfood with monks, just out of her kindness. 

                  Once, while going on her almsround, she met the Buddha. Reverentially, she stepped out of his way and paid her homage. While she was doing that, she accidentally stepped on her own robe and fell down. 

                  The Buddha consoled her and told her to understand the condition of her body. She was very old and her body frail and sick - she should practice diligently to perfect her mind. 

                  Uttarā reflected on the Buddha's words and attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V149] (DLMBS Commentary V149) A group of monks once went to the forest to practice meditation. They were very diligent and very soon they attained very deep mental absorption (**jhāna**). They mistook this attainment for the Arahantship. Happily they returned to the Buddha and intended to tell him about their achievements.

                  When they were about to approach, the Buddha asked Venerable Ānanda to send them to the cemetery first. Buddha knew about their mistaking **jhāna** for Awakenment and had an idea how to make them realize this mistake. 

                  The monks went to the cemetery and saw different corpses there. When they saw old decaying bodies and bones, they were able to perceive them with equanimity. But when they saw some fresh corpses, they realized they still had some sensual desires left in them! The Buddha exhorted them with this verse. The monks finally understood how little had they achieved so far. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V150] (DLMBS Commentary V150) Rūpanandā was the Buddha's stepsister and the fiancee of his cousin. She was very beautiful, so she was also known as Janapada Kalyāni ("Beauty of the area"). Because all of her relatives became monks and nuns, she decided to go to the monastery herself. But she did so only because of attachment to her family; she was not really devoted to the idea. 

                  As she knew that the Buddha often talked about impermanency and non-attachment to the body, she did not dare to go to see him. She thought he would scold her for her beauty. But one day she finally decided to go and listen to one of the Buddha's discourses. 

                  The Buddha knew that Rūpanandā is very attached to her body and conscious of her beauty. So he created a vision of a female form (visible only to Rūpanandā) to sit near him on the stage, where he was delivering his speech and to fan him. The girl was very young and extremely beautiful. Rūpanandā saw her and realized that compared to this girl she herself looked like a monkey. 

                  While she was looking, the girl began to grow older. She became a young woman, then a grown up woman, middle aged, old - and finally she became a very old woman. Rūpanandā realized that the change of the body is a continuing process and she found out that this beautiful young girl changed into an old ugly woman. Then the woman on stage, no longer able to control her body, was lying there, dying and finally she died. Her body got swollen and worms were all over it. 

                  Rūpanandā thus finally realized that also her beauty is very impermanent - it is a subject to illness, old age and death. The Buddha further instructed her with this verse and at the end Rūpanandā attained Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V151] (DLMBS Commentary V151) Queen Mallikā was the wife of King Pasenadi. Once she went to the bathroom to wash herself and her dog entered with her. While she bent over to wash her feet, the dog started to misbehave with her and the queen did not stop it. When she came out, the king told her he saw everything through the window and scolded her for her behavior. But Mallikā denied doing anything and suggested that the bathroom was enchanted - whoever went inside could be seen doing strange things through the window. She sent the king inside and when he came out, she told him she saw him misbehaving with a goat. The king, not being very smart accepted this as an explanation. 

                  But the queen felt very bad about lying to the king for many years. When she was dying, this moment kept coming to her consciousness over and over again. Because our dying thoughts determine our next birth, she was born in a state of suffering. The king wanted to ask the Buddha where Mallikā was reborn, but Buddha was not willing to tell him, because he did not want to hurt Pasenadi's feelings. 

                  Only after seven days in the state of suffering, the queen was reborn in Tusita heaven as a result of her great meritorious deeds. Only then did the Buddha reply to the king's question. The king was happy to hear that, but at the same time he felt sad for her death. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that everything is subject to old age and death; therefore we must practice the Dhamma diligently.

.. [DLMBSFn-V152] (DLMBS Commentary V152) There was a monk named Lāludāyi. He was not very bright. He was never able to say things, which were appropriate for the occasion. On happy occasions he would talk about suffering and sorrow and on sorrowful occasions he would talk about happiness and joy. He was also never able to understand that he did and said something inappropriate in these cases. The Buddha spoke this verse in reference to Lāludāyi. 

                  He also revealed the following story: in one of his former lives, Lāludāyi had been a farmer. He had two oxen to plow the fields. Suddenly one of them died. The farmer asked his son to go to the king and request another ox. But the son told him to go himself and taught him a verse to say in front of the king. 

                  But the farmer made a mistake and instead of "My ox died, please give me another one", he said "My ox died, please take the other one away from me". 

                  Fortunately, the king was very wise and understood that Lāludāyi just made a mistake and gave him sixteen oxen to help him with his farming.

.. [DLMBSFn-V153] (DLMBS Commentary V153) This verse and the following one (DhP 154) are the first utterances of Prince Siddhattha Gotama, after he reached the supreme Awakenment, seating under the Tree of Awakenment. From that time on he was known as the Buddha. He finally comprehended what was the reason for suffering in the round of repeated rebirths - the craving that causes us to run in it over and over again. He formulated his teaching, summarized in the Four Noble Truths and became the founder of what is today known as Buddhism.

.. [DLMBSFn-V154] (DLMBS Commentary V154) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the preceding one (DhP 153). It forms a part of the first utterance of the new Buddha (The Awakened One) just after he reached the Awakenment. He addressed the "builder" of his personality, the cravings. He finally understood that the craving is the main factor in the repeated rebirth. He destroyed "the ribs" or body of the craving and also "the roof of the house" or the reason for the round of repeated existence. His mind became dissolute, or in other words, he has reached the Nirvana. He has attained the end of all cravings and thus the end of the round of rebirth.

.. [DLMBSFn-V155] (DLMBS Commentary V155) There was a rich man, named Mahādhana. He had a son. The boy had not studied anything while young, so he remained quite ignorant. Later he married a daughter of another rich man, who had no education at all. When their parents died, the young couple inherited immense riches. But since they knew only how to spend, and not how to earn and look after the money, they became poor very quickly. They lost all of their property and had to become beggars. 

                  The Buddha saw them and commented the situation with this verse. He further said that had the young people study worldly wisdom, they would learn how to increase their riches, had they renounced the household life, they both could have attained Arahantship. But since they just wasted their youth away, they lost every opportunity - both material and spiritual.

.. [DLMBSFn-V156] (DLMBS Commentary V156) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP 155). 

                  If we want to accomplish something in our lives, we have to start working early, in the young age. Be it material or spiritual goals, we should not waste our time and diligently learn the necessary skills and then apply them on the road to the goal we want to achieve. If we do nothing in our young age, all the opportunities will be lost and we will grow old, without ever accomplishing anything.


.. [NāradaFn12-01] (Ven. Nārada 12-01) According to Buddhism there is no permanent soul or unchanging entity (atta) either created by a God or emanating from a Paramātma. Here the term atta (self) is applied to the whole body, or one's personality, or mind, or life flux.

.. [NāradaFn12-02] (Ven. Nārada 12-02) Will not be blamed by others.

.. [NāradaFn12-03] (Ven. Nārada 12-03)  Here "welfare" denotes one's ultimate goal, i.e., Nibbāna. Personal sanctification should not be sacrificed for the sake of external homage.

                    One must not misunderstand this verse to mean that one should not selflessly work for the weal of others. Selfless service is highly commended by the Buddha.

.. [BudRkFn-v164]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 164) Certain reeds of the bamboo family perish immediately after producing fruits.

.. [ThaniSFn-V157] (Ven. Thanissaro V.157) "The three watches of the night": this is the literal meaning of the verse, but DhpA shows that the image of staying up to nurse someone in the night is meant to stand for being wakeful and attentive throughout the three stages of life: youth, middle age, and old age. The point here is that it is never too early or too late to wake up and begin nurturing the good qualities of mind that will lead to one's true benefit. On this point, see A 3.51 & 52, where the Buddha counsels two old brahmans, nearing the end of their life span, to begin practicing generosity along with restraint in thought, word, and deed.

.. [ThaniSFn-V162] (Ven. Thanissaro V.162) DhpA completes the image of the poem by saying that one's vice brings about one's own downfall, just as a maluva creeper ultimately brings about the downfall of the tree it overspreads. See note 42.

.. [ThaniSFn-V164] (Ven. Thanissaro V.164) A bamboo plant bears fruit only once and then dies soon after.

.. [ThaniSFn-V165] (Ven. Thanissaro V.165) "No one purifies another. No other purifies one." These are the two meanings of the one phrase, nañño aññam visodhaye.

.. [ThaniSFn-V166] (Ven. Thanissaro V.166) AN 4.95 lists four types of people in descending order: those devoted to their own true welfare as well as that of others, those devoted to their own true welfare but not that of others, those devoted to the true welfare of others but not their own, and those devoted neither to their own true welfare nor that of others. SN 47.19 makes the point that if one is truly devoted to one's own welfare, others automatically benefit, in the same way that an acrobat maintaining his/her own balance helps his/her partner stay balanced as well.

.. [DLMBSFn-V157] (DLMBS Commentary V157) There was a prince named Bodhirāja. He had built a new palace and invited the Buddha with monks for alms offering. Because the prince had no children, he spread some pieces of cloth on the floor and made a wish that if the Buddha stepped on the cloth, he and his wife would be able to have children. 

                  When the Buddha came, he asked Bodhirāja to remove the cloth. He told him he and his wife could not have children because of evil deeds they committed in the past. The Buddha then related the story to the prince. 

                  He and his wife had been the only survivors of a shipwreck in one of their past existences. They were stranded on an island and ate the birds. They also ate their eggs and small fledglings. They did not even feel a slightest remorse for killing some other living creatures' babies. Because of that, they would not able to have any children in this life.

.. [DLMBSFn-V158] (DLMBS Commentary V158) There was a monk named Upananda. He was a very good orator. He would preach eloquently about being satisfied with little, about contentment and about austerity, but actually he was very greedy and always took all he could get. 

                  Once he wanted to spend the Rain Retreat in one monastery. When he found out that at the end of the retreat the monks there received only one robe each, he decided to go away. But he left his slippers there. It was similar at the second monastery, where the monks usually got two robes - he did not stay but left his staff. At the third monastery he left his water bottle, but himself left, because three robes that monks received there, did not satisfy him. Finally, he spent the Rain Retreat in the fourth monastery, where he received four robes at the end of the retreat. Because he left his things in three previous temples, he also claimed his share of the robes from them! 

                  So, he set on the way back to his own monastery with ten robes. On the way he met two monks, who could not agree how to divide two robes and a blanket between themselves. Upananda agreed to act as an arbiter. He gave each of them one robe and he himself kept the blanket as a payment for his arbitration. 

                  The monks went to see the Buddha and reported to him what happened. The Buddha reprimanded Upananda with this verse, saying that before one can teach others, he has to act properly - especially in the subject he wants to teach.

.. [DLMBSFn-V159] (DLMBS Commentary V159) There was a monk named Padhānika Tissa. He has several monks as his students. He taught them how to meditate and told them to be always vigilant and diligent. In the evening he would tell them to keep practicing and then he would go to sleep. At night, just when the monks were about to go to bed, he returned and told them to continue meditating. 

                  The monks were very tired because of lack of sleep. But they were still very obedient and even admired their teacher for being so diligent. Once they went to investigate how he meditates - only to find their teacher asleep! They became dissatisfied and as a result they made very little progress in their meditation. 

                  When they returned to the Jetavana monastery to see the Buddha, they told him about their teacher. The Buddha advised them with this verse, saying that a teacher should first master the subject himself completely and only then attempt to teach others.

.. [DLMBSFn-V160] (DLMBS Commentary V160) There was a young married woman who wanted to become a nun. She got permission from her husband and entered the Order. She became a pupil of Devadatta, the Buddha's cousin. Before she became a nun, she was already pregnant but did not know about it. When she found out, she asked Devadatta what to do. He sent her back to the lay life. But the woman was not happy and went to see the Buddha. The Buddha sent for Upāli, who was the master of Vinaya, rules of conduct. He further asked the king Pasenadi and the famous lay devotes, Anāthapindika and Visākhā to come and settle the case. 

                  Visākhā examined the young woman and told Upāli that she was already pregnant when she joined the Order. Upāli therefore declared that the woman was pure of any misconduct and could continue her life as a nun. Later the woman gave birth to a son. He was named Kumara Kassapa and king Pasenadi adopted him. At the age of seven, the boy became a novice and when he was eighteen, he received the full ordination. He went to the forest to practice meditation and soon attained Arahantship. He lived in the forest for twelve years and then went back to the monastery. 

                  His mother was very attached to him and whenever she saw him she would run after him calling his name. Kumara Kassapa decided that he should help his mother to get rid of this attachment. Therefore he spoke coolly to her, "How is it possible that you, as a nun, can not cut off even the affection for your son?" The woman reflected, "I have been weeping for twelve years, waiting for my son. Now he speaks so harshly to me! Why should I be attached to him?" Then she realized danger of all attachments and very soon reached Arahanthsip. 

                  The monks then remarked to the Buddha that if the woman had listened to Devadatta's words, neither she nor her son would have reached Arahantship. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in striving for the goal one must depend only on himself and not seek others to lean on.

.. [DLMBSFn-V161] (DLMBS Commentary V161) There was a lay disciple named Mahākāla. Once he spent the night in the monastery, observing the eight precepts and meditating. In the morning, on his way home, he stopped by a pond to wash his face. On the same night some thieves broke into a house and were chased by the owners. The thieves dropped their stolen things in front of Mahākāla and ran away. The owners mistook Mahākāla for a thief and beat him up. Mahākāla died of his injuries. Some monks discovered his body and reported the matter to the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha explained, that in one of his previous lives, Mahākāla fell in love with a certain woman and had beaten her husband to death. He then added this verse, saying that one's own evil deeds surely come back to their doer and fall back on his head.

.. [DLMBSFn-V162] (DLMBS Commentary V162) Some monks were discussing the subject of Devadatta, the Buddha's cousin, amongst themselves. They summed up all his bad actions: he got the confidence of prince Ajātasattu by unfair means, thus trying to gain fame. He instigated the prince to kill his own father, king Bimbisara and to become the king himself. Devadatta even tried to kill the Buddha for three times. 

                  The monks reported the matter to the Buddha and added that Devadatta was a man without shame and morality. The Buddha then said that Devadatta was trying to kill him in many if the past lives. The Buddha spoke this verse, saying that immoral people will destroy themselves - just like a creeper strangles the tree on which it is spread.

.. [DLMBSFn-V163] (DLMBS Commentary V163) The Buddha had a cousin Devadatta. He also became a monk but he was vicked. He envied the Buddha and wanted to take his place as the head of the Buddhist community. He went to see the Buddha and suggested, that since the Buddha is getting old, he, Devadatta should from now on be the leader of the Buddhist Order. The Buddha refused. Devadatta then tried to kill the Buddha three times, but he was not successful. 

                  Later Devadatta had another plan. He went to see the Buddha and suggested five new rules for all monks to follow: 1) to live only in forests, 2) to eat only almsfood, 3) to wear only robes they make themselves from discarded pieces of cloth found on rubbish heaps, 4) to sleep under trees, 5) not to eat any meat (including fish). 

                  The Buddha told him that, whoever wants to follow these rules, can do so. But they will not become binding for all the monks, because they are too strict and the Buddha's teaching teaches the Middle Path. 

                  Devadatta was angry and tried to find some more followers. Indeed, he found some young monks who thought the rules of Devadatta were much better than those, introduced by the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha questioned Devadatta about his intentions and the later admitted ha was trying to create a schism in the Community. The Buddha tried to explain him that to create a schism is a very bad deed, but Devadatta did not care. He took his followers and departed for the place called Gayasīsa where he established a new Order. Two prominents disciple of the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallana were able to make most of the Devadatta's followers realize their mistake and make them come back to the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha commented the situation with this verse, saying that good and beneficial deeds are very difficult to perform, whereas an evil deed is done very quickly and without any difficulty.

.. [DLMBSFn-V164] (DLMBS Commentary V164) In Sāvatthi there lived an old woman who was looking after a monk named Kāla. She often expressed her wish to go to the Jetavana monastery to hear the teaching from the Buddha’s own mouth. Three times she told Kāla about her wish and three times he advised her not to go. 

                  However, one day she went to the monastery in spite of his objections. Kāla thought that she would have no more use for him, if she hears the Buddha to speak. So he went to the Buddha and told him not to teach the woman anything deep, because she was very stupid. 

                  The Buddha knew the real reason for Kāla's words and he admonished him with this verse, saying that one who abuses the Teaching, is only destroying himself.

.. [DLMBSFn-V165] (DLMBS Commentary V165) There was a lay disciple named Cūlakāla. Once he spent the night in the monastery, observing the eight precepts and practicing meditation. In the morning he was returning home and met a group of thieves who were being chased by the owners of the stolen goods. The thieves put their loot in front of Cūlakāla and ran away. The owners mistook Cūlakāla for a thief and started to beat him. Some prostitutes, who were on the way to the river, saw the whole incident and told the people Cūlakāla was innocent. The owners let him go. 

                  When the Buddha was told about this, he replied with this verse and added that Cūlakāla was truly innocent and therefore had nothing to fear.

.. [DLMBSFn-V166] (DLMBS Commentary V166) Close to the age of eighty, the Buddha declared that he would attain his final Parinirvāna in four months. There were many monks who have not reached the final goal yet and they were very distressed. They wept and kept close to the Buddha all the time. There was a monk, named Attadatta who decided to honor the Buddha by attaining the Awakenment during his lifetime. So he kept alone and practiced diligently. Some other monks did not understand his intention and told Buddha, "Attadatta does not love you, he did not come to pay homage to you! He is egoistic, indeed!" Attadatta explained his behavior, saying that in his opinion the greatest homage to Buddha would be if he attained the Arahantship within the remaining four months of the Buddha's life. 

                  The Buddha approved of this and replied with this verse, saying that in spiritual attainment, one should diligently strive to reach the goal oneself and only then do other things.

.. [ThaniSFn-V170] (Ven. Thanissaro V.170) The Sutta Nipata (Sn 5.15) reports a conversation between the Buddha and the brahman Mogharaja with a point similar to that of this verse:
                    ::

                     Mogharaja:
                     In what way does one view the world
                     so as not to be seen
                       by Death's king?

                     The Buddha:
                     View the world, Mogharaja,
                          as empty —
                     always mindful
                     to have removed any view
                          about self.
                     This way one is above & beyond death.

.. [DLMBSFn-V167] (DLMBS Commentary V167) Visākhā was a very famous benefactress of the Buddhist Community from Sāvatthi. Once an older monks with his young pupil came to her house for almsfood. Visākhā's granddaughter was filtering water for the young monk and when she saw her reflection on the surface of the water, she laughed. The young monk also laughed. The girl got angry and said, "You shaven head, why do you laugh at me?!" The monk did not like it and replied, "You and your family are shaven heads yourself!" The girl went weeping to Visākhā. Visākhā tried to appease both the girl and the monk but the monk was angry and did not accept her explanations and apologies. The older monk also tried his best but did not succeed either. 

                  The matter was brought to the Buddha, who saw that the monk was ready to reach the first stage of Awakenment. So he asked Visākhā, "Why did your granddaughter had to address my monk as a shaven head? All the monks had to shave their heads when they became members of the Community!" The young monk felt very happy and praised the Buddha that he was the only one who could understand him. The Buddha then replied with this verse, saying that the monk was also to blame; he should not quarrel because of such a small and unimportant thing. Hearing that, the young monk reached the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V168] (DLMBS Commentary V168) When the Buddha attained Awakenment, one of his first big journeys took him to the city of Kapilavatthu, where most of his family lived. He stayed at the outskirts of the city, in the Nigrodhārāma monastery. His father, king Suddhodana, assumed, that his son would come to his palace for food and made a lot of almsfood prepared. However, he did not invite the Buddha, as was necessary. 

                  So the Buddha went on almsround around the city, as was his custom. He asked himself, if this was the proper course of action and realized that all the Buddhas of the past also went on almsround around the city they were born. 

                  Suddhodana heard about it and went to the Buddha, saying, "Why should my son ask for alms in the very city, where he used to travel in a golden palanquin? I am so ashamed!" 

                  The Buddha explained to him that he was only following the old custom of all the Buddhas and did not wish to put Suddhodana to shame. He also uttered this verse and the following one (DhP 169). The king finally accepted it and was no longer offended.

.. [DLMBSFn-V169] (DLMBS Commentary V169) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the preceding one (DhP 168).

.. [DLMBSFn-V170] (DLMBS Commentary V170) A group of monks went to the forest to practice meditation. But they made very little progress and decided to return to the Buddha and ask for further instructions. On the way to the monastery it was very hot and they saw a mirage. Then a storm broke out and the rain made bubbles on the ground, which soon disappeared. The monks reflected on the mirage and the bubbles, comparing it to their own bodies. Very soon they all attained Arahantship. 

                  When they related the matter to the Buddha he uttered this verse, saying that this form of meditation was very good and one is able to reach the goal quickly.

.. [DLMBSFn-V171] (DLMBS Commentary V171) Prince Abhaya was sent to repress some rebellion at the frontier. He did this job very successfully and so king Bimbisāra gave him the honor of a ruler for seven days. He was also given a young dancing girl for entertainment. But on the seventh day the girl died from exhaustion. The prince was very shocked and sad. 

                  He went to see the Buddha, who consoled him with this verse, saying that we should not be attached to worldly things.

.. [DLMBSFn-V172] (DLMBS Commentary V172) There was a monk named Sammunjjani. He spent most of his time inside the monastery, sweeping the premises. Venerable Revata was staying at the same monastery, practicing meditation. Sammunjjani thought Revata to be very lazy and one day confronted him and asked him if he did not think it would be proper for him to help him to sweep the monastery. Revata replied, that a monk should sweep for a short time in the morning and then should practice meditation and try to perceive the true nature of things in order to reach Awakenment. Sammunjjani closely followed this advice and in a very short time he became an Arahant. 

                  Some other monks then asked him why he did not sweep as much as before. Sammunjjani replied that when he was negligent, he was sweeping all the time, but now he was mindful and so does not sweep so often. The monks went to the Buddha and reported to him, that Sammunjjani claims to be an Arahant. The Buddha confirmed, that Sammunjjani indeed reached the Awakenment and added this verse for the benefit of others.

.. [DLMBSFn-V173] (DLMBS Commentary V173) In Kosala there lived a Brahmin, who was in the court of King Pasenadi. He had a son Ahimsaka. His father sent him to the famous city of Taksasilā for studies. He was very intelligent and obedient and so his teacher and his wife liked him very much. But other students were jealous of him and so accused him of having an affair with teacher's wife. The teacher, being told the same story from number of people, started to believe it. But he did not want to kill Ahimsaka. He came up with another idea. 

                  At the end of the studies, it was a custom for the students to give presents to teachers and thank them for their effort. Ahimsaka's teacher told him to kill one thousand people and bring him a garland made of one thousand fingers. Ahimsaka had no other choice, but to start killing. He started to wear the garland around his neck to keep track of the number of fingers. He therefore became known as Angulimāla ("Finger-garland"). 

                  The king dispatched some soldiers to catch him. When his mother heard about this, she went into the forest in search of her son. By that time, Angulimāla's garland had nine hundred and ninety-nine fingers on it; just one finger was missing. 

                  The Buddha realized that if he did not intervene, Angulimāla would kill his own mother in his desperation to make up the one thousand. So he went to the forest himself. 

                  When Angulimāla saw the Buddha, he ran after him with his knife. But no matter ho quickly he ran, the Buddha always stayed ahead of him. Finally, he cried, "O monk, stop!" The Buddha replied, "I have stopped, it is you who has to stop!" 

                  Angulimāla was confused and asked him what he meant. The Buddha explained, that he himself has stopped killing and hurting all living beings whereas Angulimāla has not and should therefore stop. Angulimāla realized his mistake and asked the Buddha to admit him into the Order of monks. The Buddha did so. 

                  When the king heard that Angulimāla has given up his evil deeds and was now living as a monk, he decided not to prosecute him. Angulimāla practiced meditation diligently and in the due course he attained Arahantship. 

                  But his past evil deeds were always hunting him. Whenever he went on an almsround, he became a target of stones and sticks and returned to the monastery with broken head and bleeding. The Buddha always told him to realize what suffering would await him in his future lives had he not reached the Awakenment. 

                  One day, Angulimāla saw a pregnant woman giving birth and in great pains. He recited, "Sister, since the day I became an Arahant, I have not consciously killed any living being. By the power of this truth, may you and your child be well." The woman delivered instantly and her pain ceased. This verse became known as Angulimāla-paritta and is used in similar cases to this day. 

                  When Angulimāla died, other monks asked about his future life. When the Buddha declared, that Angulimāla has attained Arahantship and therefore there were no future lives for him, some monks were surprises, how was it possible for somebody who killed so many people to have reached the goal so quickly? The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that Angulimāla's evil deeds were negated by his diligent and mindful practice of meditation and highly moral life.

.. [DLMBSFn-V174] (DLMBS Commentary V174) The Buddha once stayed in Ālavi and spoke to its people about the impermanence of life. He told them to be aware of death and to reflect that their life is uncertain. He added that they should practice mindfulness as a weapon against the death. Many people did not really understand what he was talking about, but some did. Amongst them there was a young girl, who was a weaver by profession. 

                  Later the Buddha returned to Ālavi. The girl wanted to hear his discourse, but her father asked her to wind some thread spools and bring them to him. She did the job quickly and on the way to her father she stopped by the place where the Buddha was talking and listened. 

                  The Buddha knew that the girl was ready to reach the first stage of Awakenment and so he looked at her directly. The girl approached respectfully. The Buddha then asked her four questions and she replied as follows:

                  | "Where have you come from?" "I don't know." 
                  | "Where are you going?" "I don't know." 
                  | "Don't you know?" "Yes, I know." 
                  | "Do you know?" "I don't know."

                  Many people thought her answers were disrespectful, but the girl explained. By the first question the Buddha meant if she knew what was her previous existence. She replied that she did not know. The second question meant if she knew what would be her future existence. Since she did not know, she said so. The third question meant if she did not know that she would die one day. She replied she knew. And the last question meant if she knew when exactly would she die. She did not know and replied truthfully. 

                  The Buddha applauded her and delivered a discourse. The girl attained the first stage of Awakenment. 

                  Then she continued to her father. He was asleep and she woke him up. When he was waking up, her father accidentally pulled the shuttle and the sharp point hit the girl in her chest. She died instantly and was reborn in the Tusita heaven. Her father, full of remorse and broken-hearted went to the Buddha and asked to be admitted into the Order as a monk. The Buddha granted him permission and the man attained Arahantship soon.

.. [DLMBSFn-V175] (DLMBS Commentary V175) At one occasion, thirty monks came to visit the Buddha. While they were talking, the Buddha’s attendant, Venerable Ānanda , went outside. When he came back he was surprised to see no monks inside. 

                  When asked, the Buddha said that they left flying through the air, because they attained Arahantship, including supernatural powers. 

                  Just then, the Buddha saw some swans flying in the sky and told Ānanda  that Arahants leave this world just as easily as the swans fly through the air.

.. [DLMBSFn-V176] (DLMBS Commentary V176) The Buddha did not have only admirers and devotees. Some other teachers hated him for being so famous and for taking many disciples away from them. One such teacher instigated a beautiful young girl, a pupil of his, to ruin the Buddha's fame. 

                  The girl, named Ciñca Mānavikā, would go towards the Jetavana monastery in the evening and return early in the morning, claiming she spent the night with the Buddha. After several months of this behavior, she started wrapping cloth around her stomach. She added more and more cloth to create an impression she was pregnant. Finally she went to the monastery to confront the Buddha. She accused him of making her pregnant and not caring about her. The Buddha told her not to lie, but she would just repeat her statements. 

                  Just then Sakka, the king of gods, sent some rats to bit off the strings of the cloth the girl had wrapped around her body. It fell off and her deceit was uncovered. People started to reprimand her and she ran away in shame. Later she died due to an accident. 

                  The next day some monks were discussing this story and the Buddha replied them with this verse, saying that lying is the first step towards all kinds of evil deeds. 

                  He also told them, that Ciñca Mānavikā was a king's consort in one of her previous lives. She fell in love with a crown prince, but the young man did not respond to her love. She harmed herself and accused the prince of making advances to her and when she refused, he harmed her. The king was very angry and exiled his son immediately. Later he found out the truth and punished the evil woman.

.. [DLMBSFn-V177] (DLMBS Commentary V177) King Pasenadi of Kosala was once competing with his subjects in almsgiving. However big offering the king made, his subjects always found a way to give more alms. Queen Mallikā then devised a plan. She had a great pavilion built, brought many white umbrellas and tame elephants. The elephants held the umbrellas over the monks. In the middle of the pavilion there was a lake with ten boats filled with incense and perfume. Finally, princesses served the food. Because the subjects had no elephants or umbrellas (white umbrellas could be owned only by kings) and of course had no princesses, they could not compete any more. 

                  Two ministers of the king were present. One of them praised the king for offering so much. He realized that the merit would be shared by all the living beings in the kingdom. The other minister however thought that the king was giving away the national wealth for the sake of some lazy monks. 

                  After the meal, the Buddha prepared to make a speech. He understood what the second minister was feeling and so he decided to give only a short speech instead of a long one he was originally planning. The king was disappointed by such a brief sermon and he reflected what he had done wrong. Therefore he went to the monastery and asked the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha told him about one of his ministers and explained that had he delivered a long speech, the minister would be disappointed even more. The Buddha further added this verse for the benefit of the king.

.. [DLMBSFn-V178] (DLMBS Commentary V178) Anāthapindika was a very famous benefactor of the Buddha and his followers. But his son Kāla did not have any interest in the teaching of the Buddha and would never come to attend the almsgiving ceremonies. His father was afraid that Kāla would never be able to understand the Dharma. So he promised his son one hundred pieces of gold if he went to the monastery for one day. The young man did so, but did not pay any attention to what was being said there. 

                  At another time Anāthapindika promised Kāla one thousand pieces of gold if he could recite one verse of the Buddha's teaching. Because the Buddha knew Kāla was interested only in the money, he made it impossible for him to memorize anything. Thus Kāla went to the monastery very often and gradually he was able to understand the Dharma and attained the first level of Awakenment, called Entering the Stream. 

                  In the morning of that day, he accompanied the Buddha and some monks to his father's house for the almsgiving. When his father offered him the money he earned, Kāla refused. The Buddha then explained that since Kāla attained the first level of Awakenment, he was on longer interested in the money. He further added this verse, saying that Entering the Stream was the best thing one could attain, far better than any worldly power or even attainment of a rebirth in heavens.

.. [NāradaFn14-01] (Ven. Nārada 14-01) As the Buddha had eradicated all passions of lust, hatred, and delusion they could not arise in Him any more. His spiritual victory was unconquerable.

.. [NāradaFn14-02] (Ven. Nārada 14-02) Because the eradicated passions do not arise again.

.. [NāradaFn14-03] (Ven. Nārada 14-03) Since the Buddha is devoid of the tracks (pada) of lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn14-04] (Ven. Nārada 14-04) Being omniscient.

.. [NāradaFn14-05] (Ven. Nārada 14-05) Of lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn14-06] (Ven. Nārada 14-06) Nessatha = will lead to temptation by bringing under the sway of the tempters.

.. [NāradaFn14-07] (Ven. Nārada 14-07) Here Jhāna means both concentration (samatha) and insight (vipassanā).

.. [NāradaFn14-08] (Ven. Nārada 14-08) Nekkhamma implies Nibbāna, which is gained by the subjugation of passions.

.. [NāradaFn14-09] (Ven. Nārada 14-09) What is associated with the three immoral roots of attachment (lobha), ill-will (dosa), and delusion (moha) is evil. What is associated with the three moral roots of generosity (alobha), goodwill or loving-kindness (adosa) and wisdom (amoha) is good.

.. [NāradaFn14-10] (Ven. Nārada 14-10) The religion of the Buddha is summarised in this verse.

.. [NāradaFn14-11] (Ven. Nārada 14-11) Pabbajito, one who casts aside his impurities and has left the world.

.. [NāradaFn14-12] (Ven. Nārada 14-12) Samaṇo, one who has subdued his passions, an ascetic.

.. [NāradaFn14-13] (Ven. Nārada 14-13) Pātimokkha, these are the 220 chief rules (excluding the seven ways of settling disputes) which every bhikkhu is expected to observe.

.. [NāradaFn14-14] (Ven. Nārada 14-14) Adhicitta, namely: the eight attainments (aññhasamāpatti), the four rūpa jhānas and the four arūpa jhānas. They are higher stages of mental concentration which enable one to gain supernormal powers.

.. [NāradaFn14-15] (Ven. Nārada 14-15) One's best refuge is oneself. A Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha as the Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught in order to gain his deliverance from the ills of life. The Buddha is the supreme teacher who shows the way to deliverance. The Dhamma is the unique way. The Sangha represents the Taught who have followed the way and have become living examples. One formally becomes a Buddhist by intelligently seeking refuge in this Triple Gem (Tisaraṇa). A Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the hope that he will be saved by a personal act of deliverance. The confidence of a Buddhist in the Buddha is like that of a sick person in a noted physician, or of a student in his teacher.

.. [NāradaFn14-16] (Ven. Nārada 14-16) That is, a Buddha.

.. [NāradaFn14-17] (Ven. Nārada 14-17) Sangha is the oldest, democratically constituted, historic, celibate Order, founded by the Buddha. Strictly speaking, the Sangha denotes those noble disciples who have realized the four Paths and four Fruits. The ordinary bhikkhus of the present day are merely their representatives.

.. [NāradaFn14-18] (Ven. Nārada 14-18) Papañca = impediments or obstacles such as attachment, false views and pride.

.. [NāradaFn14-19] (Ven. Nārada 14-19) Those who have extinguished the fire of lust.

.. [NāradaFn14-20] (Ven. Nārada 14-20) The passionless are fearless.

.. [BudRkFn-v190-191] (Ven. Buddharakkhita vv. 190-191) The Order: both the monastic Order (bhikkhu sangha) and the Order of Noble Ones (ariya sangha) who have reached the four supramundane stages.

.. [ThaniSFn-V183-185] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 183-185) These verses are a summary of a talk called the Ovada Patimokkha, which the Buddha is said to have delivered to an assembly of 1,250 arahants in the first year after his Awakening. Verse 183 is traditionally viewed as expressing the heart of the Buddha's teachings.

.. [ThaniSFn-V191] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 191) The noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

.. [ThaniSFn-V195-196] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 195-196) Objectification = papañca. Alternative translations of this term would be proliferation, elaboration, exaggeration, complication. The term is used both in philosophical contexts — in connection with troubles and conflict — and in artistic contexts, in connection with the way in which an artistic theme is objectified and elaborated. Sn 4.14 states that the classifications of objectification begin with the perception by which one objectifies oneself — "I am thinker" — and then spread to objectify the rest of experience around the issues caused by that perception. MN 18 explains how this leads to conflict: "Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one objectifies. Based on what a person objectifies, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye. [Similarly with the other senses.]... Now, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person: if there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of obsession with passion, irritation, views, uncertainty, conceit, passion for becoming, & ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive tale-bearing, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful actions cease without remainder."

.. [VaradoFn-V181] (Ven. Varado V.181)  Verse 181: "gods would wish their situation" (devāpi tesaṃ pihayanti). PED says pihayanti means desire or envy. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V179] (DLMBS Commentary V179) In the Kuru country there lived a Brahmin named Māgandiya. He had a very beautiful daughter. Many young men desired to marry her, but her father turned all of them down, thinking they were not good enough for her. 

                  One morning, Māgandiya went to perform his daily fire worship. On the way he met the Buddha. Immediately he decided, that the Buddha would be an ideal husband for his daughter. Quickly he returned home and took his wife and daughter with him back to the place he met the Buddha. 

                  In the meantime, the Buddha left his footprints at that place and went to another spot nearby. When Māgandiya's wife saw the footprints, she remarked, that these footprints belong to somebody, who has given up all cravings. But her husband did not pay any attention to that and proceeded to find the Buddha and offer his daughter to him. 

                  The Buddha said he was not interested. He told them how the beautiful daughters of Māra tried to seduce him. He gave up all passions, all cravings, and all attachments. Even when he saw the most beautiful women - the daughters of Māra, he felt no desire. Compared with them, Māgandiya's daughter was nothing - why should he want even to touch her? 

                  Both the Brahmin and his wife attained the third stage of Awakenment on hearing these words. Later they became a monk and a nun and soon attained Arahantship. But their daughter, Māgandiya, felt insulted and promised to take revenge on the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V180] (DLMBS Commentary V180) The commentarial story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verse (see DhP 179). 

                  As the Buddha has eradicated all cravings, destroyed all roots of evil, these cannot "lead" him anywhere, there are no more rebirths for him. Nobody can trace him or destroy him.

.. [DLMBSFn-V181] (DLMBS Commentary V181) Once, when the Buddha was staying in Sāvatthi, he was challenged by some other ascetics to perform a miracle. He therefore performed the Twin Miracle and proceeded to the Tāvatimsa heaven to teach Abhidharma there. His mother had been reborn in the Tusita heaven, but went to Tāvatimsa to learn the Teaching. After hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, his mother together with many other gods reached the first level of Awakenment. 

                  The Buddha spent three months in Tāvatimsa. Venerable Sāriputta was spending the Rain Retreat in Samkassa and taught the Abhidharma, as the Buddha instructed him. At the end of the Retreat Venerable Moggallāna went to Tāvatimsa to see the Buddha and was informed that the Buddha would be coming back to Samkassa on the fool moon day at the end of the Rain Retreat. 

                  On that day the Buddha appeared, six colored rays shining from his body. A great number of gods accompanied him and paid his homage to him before they left. Sāriputta exclaimed how magnificent the gods looked and how extraordinary that both human beings and gods respect the Buddha so much. 

                  The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that indeed even the gods envy a buddha his qualities.

.. [DLMBSFn-V182] (DLMBS Commentary V182) During the times of the past Buddha Kassapa, there was a monk. Once he committed a wrong deed and was tormented by regret. He was not able to overcome this and concentrate on his practice. Therefore he made no progress and was reborn as a Nāga. Nāgas are mythological beings, snakes that can change into humans. They are believed to have miraculous powers. 

                  This Nāga's name was Erakapatta. He had a beautiful daughter. He announced that whoever could answer her questions, could marry her. Many young men tried but nobody was successful. 

                  Once a young man named Uttara was on his way to try to answer the questions. The Buddha saw that he was very close to attaining the first stage of Awakenment, therefore he taught him answers to the questions. Immediately, Uttara attained the first stage. As a result, he had no longer desire for the Nāga princess. But he still went there to answer her questions.

                  | The girl asked: "Who is a ruler? 
                  | Uttara replied: "Who controls his six senses." 
                  | "Is someone overpowered by moral defilements to be called a ruler?" 
                  | "No, only who is free from moral defilements can be called a ruler." 
                  | "What ruler is free from moral defilements?" 
                  | "One who is free from selfishness." 
                  | "Who is to be called a fool?" 
                  | "One who strives after sensual pleasures is a fool." 

                  Uttara then answered many more questions. When Erakapatta found out that somebody was able to answer, he realized that a Buddha was again in this world. He asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. There he paid homage to the Buddha and related his story. 

                  The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that it is extremely rare to be born as a human being, and even rarer to be able to hear the Dharma from the mouth of a Buddha. 

                  At the end of the discourse many monks attained Arahantship or at least the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V183] (DLMBS Commentary V183) This gatha, simply said, is Buddhism in a nutshell. Truly, what can be explained and expanded in hundreds of books, can be also abbreviated into three main guidelines. Not doing evil deeds - the first step on the road to Awakenment. But what exactly are "evil deeds"? A deed is considered evil if it brings suffering to any living being.

                  After one refrains from doing evil deeds one needs to do good deeds - to "gather" them like flowers. Good deeds are deeds that help living beings. They are based on loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. In order to be able to do so, one must cultivate these feelings in one's heart and mind.

                  These two steps are only preparatory stages to the final and most important action - purification of mind. The first two stages are here to prepare our mind for the highest goal. Without them it would be indeed impossible to purify our minds, for a mind that harbors evil thoughts can not purify itself.

                  The last verse mentions that this is the teaching of the buddhas. Why is the plural form used here? The historical Buddha Shakyamuni is believed to be just one from the long succession of Awakened beings, buddhas, who reach the nirvana by themselves and the become teachers of the Dharma. And as this verse states, their teachings might differ, but these three basic patterns do not change in either of them. Therefore, these lines can truly be described as the very core of Buddha's teaching.

.. [DLMBSFn-V184] (DLMBS Commentary V184) Venerable Ānanda  once asked the Buddha if the basic instructions for the behavior of the monks were the same in case of the past Buddhas, or if each Awakened One sets his own rules. 

                  The Buddha replied with this verse and with the preceding one (DhP 183) and with the following one (DhP 185), saying that they were all the same. He also added that the previous Buddhas uttered these three verses also.

.. [DLMBSFn-V185] (DLMBS Commentary V185) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses (DhP 183, DhP 184). These three verses have been recited by the Buddhas of all times. It is a simple and basic summarization of most essential Buddhist teaching. Wanting little, content, not hurting others, moral life in seclusion and meditation in order to reach the highest goal, the Nirvana, complete freedom and emancipation of the mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V186] (DLMBS Commentary V186) At the Jetavana monastery there was a young monk. His teacher sent him to another monastery to practice meditation. While he was away, his father died and left some money for him with his brother. When the monk returned, he found out about this, but decided to continue living as a monk and told his brother to keep the money for himself. 

                  Later, however, he began to regret, started to imagine his comfortable life as a layman with that amount of money. He became dissatisfied with his life as a monk and began loosing weight. Other monks persuaded him to seek help from the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha told the monk this verse (and the following one, see DhP 187), saying that there is simply never enough money to satisfy the hunger. He told him the story of a king named Mandhātu, who had been a Universal Monarch a long time ago. He was reborn in Tavatimsa heaven and enjoyed immense riches and power for a long time. Then he started to wish he were the only ruler of Tavatimsa instead of Sakka, the king of the gods. Immediately he died and fell down from his heavenly state. 

                  The young monk decided to continue his life as a monk and strived diligently to attain the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V187] (DLMBS Commentary V187) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 187). 

                  It is a well-known fact that people are never satisfied with what they have. Even millionaires want to become billionaires; even kings want to become emperors. So the Buddha's message is rather simple: be satisfied with little and rather strive for the spiritual perfection, do not wish for worldly possessions.

.. [DLMBSFn-V188] (DLMBS Commentary V188) When the father of the king Pasenadi of Kosala, Mahā Kosala, was reigning, he had a head priest, named Aggidatta. When Mahā Kosala died, Aggidatta gave up his position and wealth and became an ascetic. He had many followers and lived on the border of Anga, Magadha and Kuru countries. His teaching to the people was: pay homage to forests, mountains, trees and shrines. By doing so, you will be freed from all evils. 

                  Once the Buddha sent Venerable Moggallāna to teach the Dharma to Aggidatta. When Moggallāna arrived, he asked for a place to spend the night. They refused to let him stay with them. Close to that place was a cave where lived a very powerful Nagā and Aggidatta sent Moggallāna there, thinking Nagā would kill him. Moggallāna and the Nagā had a duel, but at the end the Nagā was subdued and spread his hood over Moggallāna's head, showing him respect. 

                  In the morning, Aggidatta and his pupils went to the cave to find out what happened. When they saw the Nagā holding his head over Moggallāna, they were surprised and paid respects to Moggallāna. 

                  When the Buddha arrived there, Moggallāna got up from his seat and paid homage to the Buddha, saying that he was only a disciple, the Buddha was his teacher. When Aggidatta heard that, his respect for the Buddha was only greater. The Buddha admonished them with this verse (and following ones, DhP 189, DhP 190, DhP 191, DhP 192), saying that trees and mountains are not a real refuge; only the Three Gems (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) are the highest refuge. 

                  Aggidatta and his pupils attained Arahantship immediately. They all became monks. Later, lay disciples of Aggidatta came to that place and were confused. Who was more powerful? Aggidatta or the Buddha? Aggidatta got up from his seat and paid homage to the Buddha, saying that he was only a humble disciple, the Buddha was the highest teacher.

.. [DLMBSFn-V189] (DLMBS Commentary V189) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (DhP 188) and the following ones (DhP 190, DhP 191, DhP 192). 

                  Trees or mountains are not liberated from the round of rebirths. Neither are the protective gods that may inhabit them. Therefore, taking these things as a refuge will not help us in the goal, liberation of mind from the round of rebirths, the Samsāra.

.. [DLMBSFn-V190] (DLMBS Commentary V190) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP 188, DhP 189) and the following ones (DhP 191, DhP 192). 

                  The Triple Gem, the Buddha (Awakened One), the Dharma (his teaching) and the Sangha (the community of his followers) are the highest possible refuge, because the Buddha has reached Awakenment, the Dharma is the teaching how to reach this goal and the Sangha is the community of people who are on the way to reach it. 

                  Having taken refuge in this Triple Gem, one can clearly see the Four Noble Truths, the most important of all the Buddhist teachings. They are: 1) The truth of Suffering, 2) The truth of Origin of Suffering, 3) The truth of Extinction of Suffering and 4) The truth of the Path, leading to the Extinction of Suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V191] (DLMBS Commentary V191) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP 188, DhP 189, DhP 190) and the following one (DhP 192). 

                  These are so called Four Noble Truths, one of the most important teachings of the Buddha. They are:

                  1) The Truth of Suffering: everything in this world is connected with pain and suffering. 

                  2) The truth of Origin of Suffering: the root of suffering is our craving. 

                  3) The truth of Extinction of Suffering: by destroying the craving we also destroy all the suffering. 

                  4) The truth of the Path, leading to the Extinction of Suffering: this can be done by following the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.

.. [DLMBSFn-V192] (DLMBS Commentary V192) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP 188, DhP 189, DhP 190, DhP 191). 

                  Because the Buddha is free from the round of rebirths, his teaching can lead us in the same direction. And in the community of his followers we can help each other to reach this goal. Then we will be able to see the Four Noble Truths and lead our lives according to the Noble Eightfold Path. If we mindfully strive for the highest goal, surely we will reach it. 

                  Therefore, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are the highest possible refuge, because by following them, we can attain the Awakenment and reach freedom from suffering and the round of rebirths.

.. [DLMBSFn-V193] (DLMBS Commentary V193) Venerable Ānanda was once pondering about what the Buddha said. Thoroughbreds of elephants are born only amongst Chaddanta and Uposatha breeds, thoroughbred horses amongst Sindh breed, and thoroughbreds of cattle amongst Usabha breed. But the Buddha said nothing about thoroughbreds of people. 

                  So Ānanda decided to ask the Buddha. The Buddha told him that noble people are not born in any particular family. But wherever they are born, that family is very lucky indeed.

.. [DLMBSFn-V194] (DLMBS Commentary V194) Some monks were discussing what is the true happiness. Everybody defined the word in different way and so they realized that happiness could mean completely dissimilar things to different people. For some, money and fame were happiness, for some sensual pleasures, for some good food… 

                  They asked the Buddha what the true happiness really was. He replied them with this verse, saying that only these things constitute real happiness: arising of a Buddha in this world, opportunity to hear the Dharma, unity and harmony amongst monks.

.. [DLMBSFn-V195] (DLMBS Commentary V195) The Buddha was once on a journey with many monks, when they came to a field, which had a Brahmanic shrine nearby. A Brahmin was ploughing the field. Then the Brahmin came to the Buddha, but he paid his respects to the shrine, not to the Buddha. The Buddha praised him for this deed but then told him that there were people and objects more worthy of devotion. He made appear a golden stupa of Kassapa Buddha. He then explained that there were four classes of people worthy of a stupa. They are the Fully Awakened Buddhas, the Pacceka Buddhas (who are also awakened but lack the power to teach the Dharma), the disciples who have reached Awakenment and Universal Monarchs. The Buddha further revealed that there could be three types of stupas. The stupas with corporeal relics of such people inside, the figures and statues of them and the personal effects such as robes or bowls these people used. These people and objects are truly worthy of veneration. 

                  At the end of the discourse, the Brahmin attained the first stage of Awakenment. The golden stupa remained visible for seven days and many people came to pay their respects. After seven days the stupa disappeared and a stone stupa was erected in its place.

.. [DLMBSFn-V196] (DLMBS Commentary V196) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP 195). 

                  It is important to pay respects to those who are most worthy of it. That means basically the Buddha and his followers. By paying our respects to them, we are able to gain the most merit. Paying respects to other people is also beneficial, but can never be as good as honoring the Buddha.

                    The so-called being is composed of these five constituent parts. Both khandha and saṃkhārā are used to denote these five conditioned things. Excluding feeling and perception, the remaining fifty mental states are implied by the term saṅkhāra in the five Aggregates.

.. [DLMBSFn-V197] (DLMBS Commentary V197) On the bank of the river Rohini there was the town of Kapilavatthu, where the Buddha's own relatives, Sākyans, lived. On the other side of that river there was the town of Koliya, where lived the Koliyans, who were also related to Sākyans. Both towns and farms around it used the water from Rohini River. 

                  One year there was a severe draught. There was not enough water for everybody. Both sides started to quarrel because of water. No compromise could be found so both sides prepared to fight. 

                  The Buddha found out about this and decided to stop the bloodshed. As both armies assembled on the riverbanks, the Buddha appeared in the middle. He then admonished them, that for the sake of water, which has little value, they were willing to sacrifice their lives, which were so precious and priceless! He further told them this verse and the two following ones (DhP 198, DhP 199). Both sides became ashamed and reached a compromise. Thus the war did not happen.

.. [DLMBSFn-V198] (DLMBS Commentary V198) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 197) and also the following verse (DhP 198).

.. [DLMBSFn-V199] (DLMBS Commentary V199) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the two previous verses (DhP 197, DhP 198).

.. [DLMBSFn-V200] (DLMBS Commentary V200) The Buddha once saw that a group of young girls from Pañcasāla village was very close to attaining the first stage of Awakenment. One day, when the girls were returning from the bath at the river, the Buddha entered the village for almsfood. However, the villagers were influenced by Māra and gave him nothing. 

                  When the Buddha left the village, he met Māra who asked him if he has received enough almsfood. The Buddha, knowing that Māra influenced the villagers, admonished him for doing such a wrong deed. Māra wanted to make further fun of the Buddha and so told him to go back to the village to ask for almsfood again. 

                  When the Buddha returned to the village, the girls came back from their bath and paid their homage to him. Māra appeared again and asked the Buddha if he was not quite hungry, not having eaten anything that day. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that even if he did not get any food at all, he would sustain himself on joy and satisfaction, like the Radiant Gods, who live in constant joy and happiness.

.. [DLMBSFn-V201] (DLMBS Commentary V201) King Ajātasattu was the son of King Bimbisāra and Queen Vedehi, the sister of the King of Kosala. Ajātasattu and the King of Kosala went to war three times. The King of Kosala was always defeated. Because of this, he was very depressed. He lamented that it was a terrible disgrace; he was not able to defeat Ajātasattu, who was very young and inexperienced. The King refused to eat and just stayed in his bed all the time. 

                  When the Buddha learned about this, he admonished him with this verse. The King realized there was no victory in war and became the Buddha's devoted follower.

.. [DLMBSFn-V202] (DLMBS Commentary V202) Once the Buddha was invited for almsfood to a house on the day the daughter of the family was getting married. Her bridegroom was very excited when he was observing her bringing almsfood and as a result he was not able to pay any attention to what the Buddha said. 

                  The Buddha knew both the bride and the bridegroom were very close to realizing the Dharma and so he willed for the bridegroom not to see the bride and vice versa. Both young people then were able to pay attention to the Buddha's words. He told them this verse. 

                  Reflecting on the meaning of the verse both the bride and the bridegroom realized the Dharma and became lay followers of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V203] (DLMBS Commentary V203) Once the Buddha came to the village of Ālavi. On that day, one poor man had lost his ox and he spent the whole morning looking for it everywhere. 

                  The villagers offered almsfood to the Buddha and monks. After the meal, everybody got ready to listen to the Dharma, but the Buddha waited for the poor man, because he knew the man was very close to attaining the first stage of Awakenment. 

                  When the man found his ox, he came back to the village. He was very tired and hungry. So the Buddha directed the villagers to let him eat first and only then he expounded the Dharma. At the end of the discourse, the poor man attained the first stage of Awakenment. 

                  Later the monks asked the Buddha why he waited for the man before he delivered the discourse. The Buddha told them that the man was very hungry and very tired and if he had not eaten, he might not be able to comprehend the Dharma fully and reach the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V204] (DLMBS Commentary V204) The King Pasenadi of Kosala once came to the monastery to hear the Dharma. But on that day he ate too much and as a result he was sleepy, did not pay much attention and was only sitting there and nodding. 

                  Seeing him, the Buddha advised him not to overeat, because moderation in food brings comfort to the body. Pasenadi did as he was told and after a time he lost some weight, was more fit and began to feel much better. 

                  The Buddha then told him this verse, saying that health is the greatest gain and we should do everything to attain it.

.. [DLMBSFn-V205] (DLMBS Commentary V205) The Buddha announced that in four months he would attain his final Parinirvana (death of a Buddha or any fully Awakened person). Many monks who had not yet attained the Awakenment were sad and depressed. They all came to the presence of the Buddha and paid him their respects. 

                  But Venerable Tissa decided that he would pay the highest honor to the Buddha by attaining the Awakenment while he was still alive. Therefore he went to the secluded place in the forest and practiced meditation diligently. 

                  Other monks did not understand his intentions and reported to the Buddha that Tissa had no respect for him and kept to himself instead of coming to pay his respects to the teacher. 

                  The Buddha told them that Tissa was striving to attain Awakenment before the teacher died and then explained that this was the best way to honor the Buddha. The best salutation to the Buddha is practicing the Dharma diligently. At the end, the Buddha told the monks this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V206] (DLMBS Commentary V206) Ten months before he reached the Parinirvana, the Buddha was staying at the village of Beluva. While he was there, he got sick. He suffered from dysentery. Sakka, the King of the Gods, personally came to attend to him. The Buddha told him there were many monks who could help him around, but Sakka insisted on helping the Buddha personally. 

                  The monks were very surprised to find Sakka attending to the Buddha. The Buddha told them there was nothing surprising about this. In his previous life, Sakka heard the Dharma just for a short while, moments before he died. As a result, he was born as the present Sakka, the King of the Gods. Then the Buddha told the monks this verse and two following ones (DhP 207, DhP 208).

.. [DLMBSFn-V207] (DLMBS Commentary V207) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 206) and the following one (DhP 208). 

                  The company of fools is not good for someone who wants to achieve his spiritual goal. In the company of fools we will learn nothing new, nothing important or good. We will only stagnate and eventually we will become just one of the fools.

.. [DLMBSFn-V208] (DLMBS Commentary V208) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 206 and DhP 207). 

                  As the moon follows and "associates with" the stars on the night sky, so should people who want to reach the highest goal follow and associate with only the best companions, who can teach one a lot on the way to the spiritual progress.

.. [NāradaFn16-14] (Ven. Nārada 16-14) The reference is to the Anāgāmis (Never-Returners) who, after death, are born in the Pure Abodes. They are not born in the sense-sphere as they have eradicated sense-desires.

.. [BudRkFn-v218] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 218) One Bound Upstream: a non-returner (anagami).

.. [ThaniSFn-V209] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 209) This verse plays with the various meanings of yoga (task, striving, application, meditation) and a related term, anuyuñjati (keeping after something, taking someone to task). In place of the Pali reading attanuyoginam, "those who kept after themselves," the Patna Dhp reads atthanuyoginam, "those who kept after/remained devoted to the goal."

.. [ThaniSFn-V218] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 218) "The up-flowing stream": DhpA: the attainment of non-returning, the third of the four stages of Awakening (see note 22).

.. [ThaniSFn-V219] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 219) The Pali in these verses repeats the word "comes" three times, to emphasize the idea that if the results of meritorious actions await one after death, one's going to the next world is more like a homecoming.

.. [DLMBSFn-V209] (DLMBS Commentary V209) A young man from Sāvatthi became a monk. Both his parents were very strongly attached to their son, so they left home too. But even in the monastery they could not live without each other. They stayed together, ate together, all day only talking, as if they were still at home. When the Buddha heard this, he admonished them strongly that by becoming monks and a nun, they should leave behind all worldly attachments. He also told them this verse as well as the two following ones (DhP 210, DhP 211).

.. [DLMBSFn-V210] (DLMBS Commentary V210) The story of this verse is identical with the one for the previous (DhP 209) and the following (DhP 211) verses. 

                  Meeting people one does not like is truly suffering. Therefore we should avoid seeing them at all. But what about the ones we love? We suffer when they are away or when they die. So, it is best to avoid meeting them too and rather concentrate on the goal and meditate with strong effort.

.. [DLMBSFn-V211] (DLMBS Commentary V211) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous ones (DhP 209, DhP 210). 

                  To be separated from the ones we love is painful. Therefore we should not hold anything dear. In this way, when we do not love or hate anything or anybody, there are no bonds for us and we can reach Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V212] (DLMBS Commentary V212) One rich man had a son and loved him very much. The son got ill and died. The man was extremely depressed. Every day he went to the cemetery and wept there. Once the Buddha met him there and asked what happened. The rich man told the Buddha about his son. 

                  The Buddha consoled him with this verse, saying that since everything and everybody must die, we should not be attached to people and things. The rich man immediately attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V213] (DLMBS Commentary V213) Visākhā, a famous benefactress of the Buddha and his followers, had a granddaughter, who died suddenly. Visākhā was very sad and she came to see the Buddha and expressed her feelings. The Buddha told her to realize how many people died every day only in the city of Sāvatthi. If we were to regard all of them as our children and grandchildren, we would be weeping all day. He also told Visākhā this verse, saying that sorrow arises out of love.

.. [DLMBSFn-V214] (DLMBS Commentary V214) Once the Buddha with some monks entered the city of Vesāli during a festival day. On their way they met some local princes, all dressed up in beautiful clothes. The Buddha told the monks to look at the princes, because they resemble the gods from Tāvatimsa heaven. 

                  On their way to the garden, the ptrinces met a beautiful courtesan. They invited her to join them. But they started to quarrel over her and soon they were fighting. At the end some of them had to be carried home bleeding. 

                  The Buddha told the monks this verse, saying that grief and sorrow are born from affection and sensual pleasures.

.. [DLMBSFn-V215] (DLMBS Commentary V215) In Sāvatthi there lived a young man named Anitthi Gandha Kumāra. He was to marry a beautiful young girl from Sāgala. But the bride got ill and died on her way to his house. The man became very sad, grieving all the time. 

                  The Buddha came to his house one day and after being offered almsfood, he asked for the reason of his sorrow. The young man told him the story of his ruined marriage. The Buddha replied him with this verse, saying that from pleasure and lust, only pain and sorrow can come out. The young man attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V216] (DLMBS Commentary V216) In Sāvatthi there lived a brahmin. He was not a follower of the Buddha. But because the Buddha knew he head the ability to attain the first stage of Awakenment, he went to the field where the brahmin was ploughing his field. The brahmin was very friendly and they talked many times. Every time the Buddha would visit him, the brahmin kept telling him he would offer him some rice after the harvest. The Buddha said nothing; because he knew this year the brahmin would get no harvest at all. 

                  One day there was a heavy rain and all the rice was destroyed. The brahmin was sad, because now he could not fulfill his promise. But the Buddha told him this verse, saying that only because of thirst and craving there is suffering and pain. The brahmin attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V217] (DLMBS Commentary V217) One day the Buddha with some monks went to the city of Rājagaha to obtain some almsfood. On the way they met a group of young boys with a basket full of cakes. The boys paid their respects to the Buddha but they did not offer him any cakes. 

                  Just then Venerable Kassapa came along. The boys immediately offered the cakes to him. Kassapa then advised the boys to offer some cakes to the Buddha and they did so. Later, some monks wondered why the boys liked Kassapa so much. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that whoever has so many good qualities like Kassapa, is always liked by people and gods.

.. [DLMBSFn-V218] (DLMBS Commentary V218) There was an old monk who had many disciples. Many times they asked him about his attainments, but he never said anything. He has attained the third stage of Awakenment, but he decided he would not say anything, until he attained the full Awakenment. But he passed away without attaining the Arahantship and never told his pupils anything. 

                  The disciples thought their teacher had not attained any stage of Awakenment and fell very sorry. They asked the Buddha about this matter. The Buddha told him their teacher had actually attained the third stage, called Anāgāmi (never coming back again). He was reborn in high abodes of the Brahma heaven, never to come back to this world again. He would eventually reach the Awakenment there. The Buddha also told the students why their teacher never said anything - he was modest and also a bit ashamed he head not reached the full Arahantship. The Buddha also added this verse, describing their teacher.

.. [DLMBSFn-V219] (DLMBS Commentary V219) In the city of Benares there lived a rich man named Nandiya. Once he listened to the Buddha’s discourse on the benefits of giving. He built a monastery and furnished it. Immediately a mansion came up for him in the Tāvatimsa heaven, awaiting him. 

                  Venerable Moggallāna once visited the Tāvatimsa world and saw the mansion built there for Nandiya. When he returned back, he asked the Buddha about this. The Buddha replied with this verse (and the following one, DhP 220), saying that the good deeds await the well-doer in the next world as surely as the relatives and friends await somebody who is long away from home.

.. [DLMBSFn-V220] (DLMBS Commentary V220) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 219). 

                  Just like the rich man Nandiya from the story, we will reap the fruit of our good deeds - if not in this life, then in the next one. Our good deeds will "welcome" us immediately and we will be able to taste their outcome. Maybe we will have a mansion in heaven, like Nandiya. Or maybe we will be just a little bit wiser and more able to strive for our Awakenment.

.. [NāradaFn17-01] (Ven. Nārada 17-01) Speech and thoughts are also herein implied.

                  1) personality belief (sakkāya-diṭṭhi), 
                  2) skeptical doubt (vicikicchā), 
                  3) clinging to rules and rituals (sīlabbata-paramāsa), 
                  4) sensuous craving (kāma-rāga), 
                  5) ill-will (vyāpāda). 
  
                  The five small fetters are: 

                  1) craving for fine-material existence (rūpa-rāga), 
                  2) craving for immaterial existence (arūpa-rāga), 
                  3) conceit (māna), 
                  4) restlessness (uddhacca), 
                  5) ignorance (avijjā).

                  Venerable Anuruddha once came to Kapilavatthu to see his relatives. All of them came to meet him; only his sister Rohini did not come. Anuruddha asked about her and learned that she was suffering from a skin disease. Anuruddha sent for her and told her to perform some meritorious deeds. Rohini began to build a community hall. Even before the construction was completed, she started to sweep it every day and fill the water pots. She began to feel better immediately. 

                  When the hall was finished, the Buddha and monks were invited for an almsfood there. After the meal the Buddha asked Rohini to come. He then revealed, that she was suffering because of evil deed done in one of her previous lives. 

                  She was the queen of Benares. The king had a dancer he liked very much. The queen became jealous and instructed her servants to put some itching powder into the dancer's bed. Thus the dancer itched all over and when she went to bed to rest, her condition got even worse. 

                  The Buddha then exhorted her and all the people present to give up anger and pride and not to cling to anything. He further added this verse. Rohini and some other people attained full Awakenment immediately. At the same time Rohini's disease was cured and her skin became smooth and clear.

.. [DLMBSFn-V222] (DLMBS Commentary V222) Once a certain monk wanted to build a hut for himself. He chose a tree and was about to cut it down. But a spirit lived in that tree with her son. The spirit asked the monk not to cut down their tree, but the monk did not listen. So the spirit put her son on the tree, hoping this would prevent the monk from cutting the tree down. 

                  But the monk's ax was already swinging down and he was unable to stop it. The ax fell and cut of the baby's arm. The spirit became very angry and was about to kill the monk. But then she reflected and decided not to harm the monk, because she would acquire a lot of demerit. So instead, she went to see the Buddha and told him all what happened. 

                  The Buddha told her this verse, praising her for her self-control. He then taught her the Dharma. After reflecting on what was taught, the spirit realized the Dharma. She was offered a new tree to live in, in vicinity of the monastery. 

                  After this incident, the Buddha made a new rule for the monks, forbidding them to hurt plant life.

.. [DLMBSFn-V223] (DLMBS Commentary V223) In Sāvathi there lived a rich man named Sumana. He had a servant named Puṇṇa. Once Puṇṇa and his wife offered almsfood to Venerable Sāriputta and as a result of this deed, Puṇṇa found gold in the field he was ploughing. The king declared him to be the royal banker and the whole family became extremely rich and influential. Once Puṇṇa and his family were offering almsfood to the Buddha and the monks for seven days. After hearing the Dharma from the Buddha the whole family, Puṇṇa, his wife and their daughter Uttarā, attained the Awakenment. 

                  Uttarā got married to the son of Sumana. Because the family was not Buddhist, she was not able to perform meritorious deeds. Her father sent her some money and arranged for a woman named Sirimā to look after the household for a few days. 

                  During this time, Uttarā was offering almsfood to the Buddha and the monks. When her husband saw her, he smiled, because he did not understand the significance of giving and thought her stupid. But Sirimā, seeing him smile, forgot she was there only for a few days, and became jealous. She brought some boiling oil with the intention to pour it over the head of Uttarā. Uttarā knew what was about to happen but she did not feel any anger or hatred. She was very grateful to Sirimā, because only with her help was she able to perform meritorious deeds. She made a firm resolution not to let any anger or hatred enter her mind. 

                  The boiling oil then became harmless, like cold water. Sirimā did not understand and went to get another pot of hot oil. But by then other servants caught her and beat her up. 

                  Then Sirimā realized what she had done and asked Uttarā for forgiveness. Uttarā told her to go to see "her father" - she meant the Buddha, who has taught her the Dharma and helped her to reach the Awakenment. 

                  The Buddha listened to all what happened. Then he praised Uttarā for not feeling any anger or hatred. He told her this verse. At the end, Uttarā forgave Sirimā.

.. [DLMBSFn-V224] (DLMBS Commentary V224) Venerable Moggallāna once visited the heaven world and asked the gods what good deeds had they done to be reborn in such happy state. Different gods had different answers. One was reborn as a god only because he always spoke truth. Another goddess said that she was a servant who never got angry with her master and never hated him, although he beat and abused her. Some gods replied they offered what little they could for the benefit of others. 

                  Moggallāna returned back and asked the Buddha if it was really possible to be reborn as a god just by these deeds. The Buddha confirmed it and spoke this verse, saying even little good deeds lead to heaven.

.. [DLMBSFn-V225] (DLMBS Commentary V225) The Buddha was once in the city of Sāketa for almsfood. While he was passing a certain brahmin’s house, the brahmin welcomed him: "Son, we have not seen you for a long time. Come and visit us again!" When the Buddha entered the house, the brahmin's wife also welcomed him as a long lost son. From that day, they offered almsfood to the Buddha. 

                  The monks asked why did they call the Buddha their son. The Buddha explained that he had been their son for a great many lives in the past. The Buddha stayed with them for three months and both the brahmin and his wife attained the Awakenment. 

                  Later the monks asked where were they reborn, since they did not know the couple had already reached the Nirvana. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the Arahants are not reborn anywhere, they have attained the Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V226] (DLMBS Commentary V226) There was a young slave girl, named Punnā. One night she was doing some work for her master, when she saw some monks going to their rooms after listening to the Dharma. She pondered that she was up so late because she was poor and had to work hard. But she could not think about any reason for the monks to be up so late as well. 

                  The next day she made for herself a simple rice cake and went to the riverside to rest and eat. But on the way she met the Buddha and offered the cake to him. The Buddha accepted and ate the cake. 

                  After eating, the Buddha told her why the monks were up so late: they were always vigilant and learning something, no matter what time it was. He also told her this verse, saying that by being always watchful and mindful, one can eradicate one's taints. Punnā immediately realized the Dharma. 

                  Traditionally, these four taints (**āsava**) are mentioned in the texts: sense desire (**kāma**), desiring eternal existence (**bhava**), wrong views (**diṭṭhi**) and ignorance (**avijjā**).

.. [DLMBSFn-V227] (DLMBS Commentary V227) There was a man named Atula. Once he and his friends wanted to hear the Dharma. They went to see Venerable Revata. But he was practicing meditation and did not tell them anything. They were disappointed and so went to see Venerable Sāriputta. He expounded the Dharma in length, telling them many profound teachings they did not quite understand. Still unhappy, they went to Venerable Ānanda. He explained shortly basic teachings of the Buddha. 

                  Atula and his friends then went to see the Buddha. They complained. Revata did not say anything at all, Sāriputta spoke too much and Ānanda too little. After such a long time, they still were not satisfied. The Buddha replied with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 228, DhP 229 and DhP 230), saying that, as before, so today, there is no one who is never blamed.

.. [DLMBSFn-V228] (DLMBS Commentary V228) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 227) and the following verses (DhP 229, DhP 230). 

                  Even the best of people are always blamed by somebody for something. Gandhi was killed although he was very close to what we call "a saint". Therefore, even if we encounter someone who is hostile to us, we should not feel hatred or enmity.

.. [DLMBSFn-V229] (DLMBS Commentary V229) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 227, DhP 228) and the following verse (DhP 230).

.. [DLMBSFn-V230] (DLMBS Commentary V230) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 227, DhP 228 and DhP 229).

.. [DLMBSFn-V231] (DLMBS Commentary V231) A group of six monks wearing wooden shoes and each holding a staff, were walking on a big stone, making a lot of noise and disturbing the peace of other monks. The Buddha asked Venerable Ānanda what was going on and having learned about the six monks, he admonished them with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 232, DhP 233 and DhP 234). He also made a new rule for the monks not to wear wooden shoes.

.. [DLMBSFn-V232] (DLMBS Commentary V232) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 231) and the following ones (DhP 233, DhP 234). 

                  By this verse the Buddha stressed that both the right conduct in bodily deeds and the right conduct in verbal speech are equally important.

.. [DLMBSFn-V233] (DLMBS Commentary V233) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 231, DhP 232) and the following one (DhP 234). 

                  Even the thinking is very important. Truly, mental action is probably the most important of the three (bodily, verbal, mental). The bodily and verbal actions are only byproducts of the mental action. Thinking comes first and only after that we act with our body or our mouth. Therefore, the key to controlling our bodily and verbal actions lays in controlling our minds.

.. [DLMBSFn-V234] (DLMBS Commentary V234) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 231, DhP 232 and DhP 233).

.. [NāradaFn18-01] (Ven. Nārada 18-01) Namely: the Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsa).

.. [NāradaFn18-02] (Ven. Nārada 18-02) Atidhonacāri = the bhikkhu who lives without reflecting on the necessaries of life. While using the four requisites, namely: robes, food, drink, and lodging, a bhikkhu is expected to reflect on their special usefulness and loathsomeness. If he does not, he transgresses a minor rule by not using them properly. Dhona means the four necessaries.

.. [NāradaFn18-03] (Ven. Nārada 18-03) Mantā mean religious doctrines, arts and sciences. Non-recitation of the scriptures and non-practice of the arts tend to make one forget them.

.. [NāradaFn18-04] (Ven. Nārada 18-04) Ghara is interpreted as householders.

.. [NāradaFn18-05] (Ven. Nārada 18-05) Adhammo is here used in the sense of hatred. The root causes of evil are greed and hatred.

.. [NāradaFn18-06] (Ven. Nārada 18-06) Samādhi, mundane or supramundane concentration.

.. [NāradaFn18-07] (Ven. Nārada 18-07) Kaliü = attabhāva = body.

.. [NāradaFn18-08] (Ven. Nārada 18-08) Kitavā = kitavāya = by means of sham branches etc.

.. [NāradaFn18-09] (Ven. Nārada 18-09) Namely: the Fruit of Arahantship. See note on v. 226.

.. [NāradaFn18-10] (Ven. Nārada 18-10) Outside the Dispensation (sāsana) of the Buddha.

.. [NāradaFn18-11] (Ven. Nārada 18-11) Here samaṇa refers to Saints who have realised the four Paths and four Fruits. They are the Ariya Saints who have attained Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn18-12] (Ven. Nārada 18-12) Impediments such as craving, pride, etc.

.. [NāradaFn18-13] (Ven. Nārada 18-13) An epithet of the Buddha. Literally, it means "who thus hath come".

.. [NāradaFn18-14] (Ven. Nārada 18-14) Saṅkhāra means the five aggregates conditioned by causes.

.. [NāradaFn18-15] (Ven. Nārada 18-15) There is no single impediment such as craving, pride, and so on, by means of which the Buddhas regard the conditioned things as eternal.

.. [BudRkFn-v254-255] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (vv. 254-255) Recluse (samana): here used in the special sense of those who have reached the four supramundane stages.

.. [ThaniSFn-V235] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 235) Yama = the god of the underworld. Yama's minions or underlings were believed to appear to a person just prior to the moment of death.

.. [ThaniSFn-V236] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 236) Impurities, blemishes = passion, aversion, delusion, and their various permutations, including envy, miserliness, hypocrisy, and boastfulness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V240] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 240) "One who lives slovenly": As DhpA makes clear, this refers to one who uses the requisites of food, clothing, shelter, and medicine without the wisdom that comes with reflecting on their proper use. The Pali term here is atidhonacarin, a compound built around the word dhona, which means clean or pure. The ati- in the compound could mean "overly," thus yielding, "one overly scrupulous in his behavior," but it can also mean "transgressing," thus, "transgressing against what is clean" = "slovenly." The latter reading fits better with the image of rust as a deficiency in the iron resulting from carelessness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V254-255] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 254-255) "No outside contemplative": No true contemplative, defined as a person who has attained any of the four stages of Awakening, exists outside of the practice of the Buddha's teachings (see note 22). In DN 16, the Buddha is quoted as teaching his final student: "In any doctrine & discipline where the noble eightfold path is not found, no contemplative of the first... second... third... fourth order [stream-winner, once-returner, non-returner, or arahant] is found. But in any doctrine & discipline where the noble eightfold path is found, contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order are found. The noble eightfold path is found in this doctrine & discipline, and right here there are contemplatives of the first... second... third... fourth order. Other teachings are empty of knowledgeable contemplatives. And if the monks dwell rightly, this world will not be empty of arahants." (On the noble eightfold path, see note 191.)

                         On "objectification," see note 195-196.

.. [VaradoFn-V240] (Ven. Varado V.240)  Verse 240: "those who live indulgently" (atidhonacārinaṃ). PTS: indulging too much in the use of the four requisites. 
    
.. [VaradoFn-V254a] (Ven. Varado V.254a) Verse 254a: "off the Path, no saints (samaṇo) do lie". 'Samaṇo' can mean one who has attained one of the four stages of Buddhist sainthood (e.g. see D.2.151). 
    
.. [VaradoFn-V254b] (Ven. Varado V.254b) Verse 254b: "Though people relish Self-perceptions (papañcā), Buddhas have no such conceptions". PED (papañcā): obstacle, illusion, diffuseness. But S.4.202 says “I am” is papañcā (asmīti bhikkhave papañcitametaṃ)

.. [DLMBSFn-V235] (DLMBS Commentary V235) In Sāvathi there lived an old butcher. He was used to eating beef curry every day. Once he put aside some meat to be cooked that day and went for a bath. In the meantime, his wife saw the meat and sold it. Therefore, when the butcher returned home, he realized that there would be no meat that day. He was so angry that he went and cut off the tongue of an ox. He has his wife to prepare it and began to eat. 

    When he tried to take bite of the tongue, he bit off his own tongue. The butcher died in great pain and agony and was reborn in a painful state. 

    The butcher's son was afraid that this evil would befall him as well so he left the city and went to Takkasilā (Taxilā). He became a goldsmith, got married and had children. When he got old, he and his family moved back to Sāvathi. His children were followers of the Buddha but he was not. The children were concerned for their father and so one day they invited the Buddha and monks for a meal. After the meal they told the Buddha that this offering was on behalf of their father. They asked the Buddha to give a discourse to the old man to help him to see the Dharma. 

    The Buddha told the old goldsmith this verse (and the following ones, DhP 236, DhP 237 and DhP 238). At the end for the discourse, the old goldsmith attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V236] (DLMBS Commentary V236) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 235) and the following ones (DhP 237, DhP 238). 

    We should strive and make the best effort in order to purify our minds and make the best of our lives. By doing this, we will reach "the place of the Noble Ones", the Nirvana, the complete purification of the mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V237] (DLMBS Commentary V237) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 235 and DhP 236) and the following one (DhP 238). 
    Although this verse was originally told to an old man, it is actually true for all of us. We all are very close to death, even if we might be still young and healthy. Nobody ever knows the time of his death. Therefore, we all should make our best effort to overcome the defilements of our minds before it is too late.

.. [DLMBSFn-V238] (DLMBS Commentary V238) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 235, DhP 236 and DhP 237). 

    If we strive and exert ourselves, we will purify our minds, attain the Awakenment - and therefore there will be no more birth, sickness, aging and death for us. Then we do not have to fear the death any longer.

.. [DLMBSFn-V239] (DLMBS Commentary V239) Once a brahmin saw a group of monks preparing to enter the city for almsfood. They were rearranging their robes in order to go to the city. The brahmin saw that the robes touched the ground and got wet because of dew. So he cleared that place of grass. The next day he saw that the ground is dirty and it soiled the robes. So he covered the place with sand. During the next few days he saw that when the sun is shining the monks sweat and when it rains, they get wet. Therefore he built a shelter at that place. 

    When it was ready, the brahmin invited the Buddha and monks for an almsfood. He then explained how he performed this good deed gradually. The Buddha replied him with this verse, saying that one should use every little opportunity to perform good deeds and cleanse one's mind of impurities.

.. [DLMBSFn-V240] (DLMBS Commentary V240) A certain monk named Tissa received a beautiful robe and was very happy. He prepared to wear them the next day, but that very night he died. Because he was too attached to the robe, he was born as an insect in it. 

    The monks decided to share his former robe amongst themselves. The insect was very angry and shouted, "They are destroying my robe!" The Buddha heard this and told the monks to leave the robe untouched for seven days. 
    Later the insect died and was reborn in a happy state because of his former good deeds. The Buddha explained to the monks that if they were to use the robe while the insect was stile alive, he would feel hate and anger and would have to be born in miserable existence. The Buddha then told this verse, saying that the monks should not be attached to anything, especially not to their four requisites.

.. [DLMBSFn-V241] (DLMBS Commentary V241) Venerable Sāriputta and Mahā Moggallāna used to deliver discourses in the city of Savatthi. Many people praised them for speaking clearly and eloquently. There was a monk named Lāludāyii who remarked that if he were invited to speak, people would praise him even more. So people invited him to deliver a discourse. But when Lāludāyii got to the platform, he could not open his mouth. So he asked another monk to speak first and that he would speak next. This happened three times. 

    People realized that he was just boasting and laughed at him and reprimanded him. Lāludāyii left in shame. 
    When the Buddha learned about this incident, he spoke this verse, saying that Lāludāyii did not study much and what he did study, he already forgot.

.. [DLMBSFn-V242] (DLMBS Commentary V242) A certain woman committed adultery. Her husband was very ashamed and he avoided his friends and the Buddha. But after some time he came to see the Buddha and told him about his trouble. The Buddha told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 243), saying that all these taints originate from ignorance.

.. [DLMBSFn-V243] (DLMBS Commentary V243) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous one (DhP 242). 

    All the other stains, such as wrong conduct etc. are derived from the main "impurity", ignorance. It is because we are ignorant of the true reality, that we commit these evil deeds. Therefore, only if we destroy our ignorance, can we truly be called "pure". Destruction of ignorance is the main goal of the Buddha's teaching. This is what is called Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V244] (DLMBS Commentary V244) There was a monk named Cūla Sāri. He was a physician and he often went to see patients. Once he was returning from a patient and he met Venerable Sāriputta. Cūla Sāri told him his patient gave him delicious food as a payment. He offered some food to Sāriputta, who did not say anything and just continued on his way. 

    Later Sāriputta reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha told Cūla Sāri not to practice medicine for personal gain and told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 245).

.. [DLMBSFn-V245] (DLMBS Commentary V245) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 244). 

    One who is always trying to do good things, not to offend anyone, has indeed a difficult life. Always thinking about one's action, always mindful and reflecting on one's deeds, thoughts and words - these are just the basic requirements for such a way of life. 

    On the other hand, if we just do not care about others, if we do not think about how our actions can cause suffering and pain, then the life is very easy. 
    If we want to walk on the Buddha's path we should try our best to lead the difficult kind of life. After all, reflection and mindfulness are a part of meditation.

.. [DLMBSFn-V246] (DLMBS Commentary V246) Not only monks stayed at the Jetavana monastery. Lay followers would also come to stay for a few days, observe precepts and meditate. Once five lay disciples observed one precept each. They all claimed that he was observing the most difficult precept. They argued for a long time and then reported the matter to the Buddha. 

    The Buddha replied them with this verse (and the following ones, DhP 247 and DhP 248), saying that all the precepts are very difficult and all of them are equally important for a good life.

.. [DLMBSFn-V247] (DLMBS Commentary V247) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 246) and the following one (DhP 248). 

    To observe precepts and to lead a moral life is very difficult, but it is a basic step towards the Awakenment. That is why the Buddha says in this verse. If we do not follow them, we "dig out our own roots". That is to say, we postpone entering the way to Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V248] (DLMBS Commentary V248) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 246, DhP 247). 

    As it is very difficult to observe the precepts and to lead a moral life, it is also very easy to break them. And it is also very easy to loose self-control. Once we lose it, it is extremely hard to get things back on track and to start our way towards Awakenment again. Therefore we will be suffering for a prolonged period of time.

.. [DLMBSFn-V249] (DLMBS Commentary V249) There was a young novice named Tissa. He always criticized other people's good deeds. He even scolded famous donors like Anātha Pindika and Visākhā. He also boasted that his parents were extremely rich and anybody could come to them and receive many precious gifts. 

    Some monks decided to see if this was true. They went to Tissa's village only to find out that his parents were poor and that Tissa was only boasting. They returned and reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha reprimanded the young novice with this verse (and the following one, DhP 250).

.. [DLMBSFn-V250] (DLMBS Commentary V250) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 249). 

    Discontentment is one of the main roots of a disturbed mind. If we are not happy about what others do, how then can we attain a peace of mind? Discontent with what other monks receive as alms is only one such example. 
    When we destroy such discontentment completely, then we are able to attain a peace of mind and therefore we can concentrate our minds and start on the way towards the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V251] (DLMBS Commentary V251) Once there were five lay followers listening to the Buddha's discourse. One of them was sleeping, the second one was scratching the ground with his hands, the third was shaking a tree and the fourth was looking up at the sky. But the fifth one listened carefully and respectfully. Ānanda saw them and after the discourse was over he asked the Buddha about their behavior. 

    The Buddha explained that the first one was a snake in his previous life therefore he liked to sleep. The second one was a subterranean animal, the third was a monkey and the fourth one was an astrologer. But the fifth one was a learned man; therefore he was able to listen with attention. 

    Ānanda then asked what things prevent people from listening and understanding the Dharma. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying it is passion, hatred, delusion and thirst.

.. [DLMBSFn-V252] (DLMBS Commentary V252) In the town of Bhaddiya there lived a rich man named Mendaka. When the Buddha arrived at Bhaddiya, he realized that Mendaka and his whole family are able to understand the Dharma. He explained the teaching to them and after hearing the Dharma from him, Mendaka, his wife, son, daughter-in-law and servant all attained the first level of Awakenment. Mendaka related how many ascetic teachers spoke ill of the Buddha and tried to dissuade Mendaka from seeing the Buddha. The Buddha explained by this verse, that it is only very natural to see others' faults and not to see one's own. 

    The Buddha then revealed the past existences of Mendaka. He was always a rich man who donated many things to those seeking Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V253] (DLMBS Commentary V253) There was a monk named Ujjhāna Saññi. He was always finding faults with others, very easy to get angry and speaking ill of people. When the Buddha found out, he spoke this verse. He also added that sometimes finding faults with others is good. When we see somebody to misbehave and we try to teach him good ways - that is worthy of praise. But if we do it out of spite and malice, then we won't be able to achieve concentration and therefore we get further and further away from the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V254] (DLMBS Commentary V254) The Buddha passed away in the town of Kusinarā. At that time the ascetic named Subhadda stayed at Kusinarā. He went to many religious teachers but none could satisfy his doubts and Subhadda did not become their pupil. Just before the Buddha died, Subhadda approached him and asked him some questions. The Buddha answered them in this verse (and the following one, DhP 255). Subhadda became a monk and later attained the Awakenment. He was the last direct pupil of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V255] (DLMBS Commentary V255) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 254). 

    The Buddhas, Awakened Ones have no "shaking". The meaning of this is that there is no instability, no wavering or unsteadiness of their minds. They have reached the highest Awakenment and their minds are truly firm and steady.

.. [NāradaFn19-01] (Ven. Nārada 19-01) Kāyena - that is, nāmakāyena, through the mental body, or, in other words, through self-realization.

.. [NāradaFn19-02] (Ven. Nārada 19-02) Thera - a term applied to those bhikkhus who have counted at least ten years in the Order from the date of their higher ordination. Thera, literally, means one who is firm or stable.

.. [NāradaFn19-03] (Ven. Nārada 19-03) Saccaṃ - the four noble truths.

.. [NāradaFn19-04] (Ven. Nārada 19-04) Dhammo - the nine supramundane states.

.. [NāradaFn19-05] (Ven. Nārada 19-05) Saññamo - morality and sense-restraint.

.. [NāradaFn19-06] (Ven. Nārada 19-06) By means of the four Paths.

.. [NāradaFn19-07] (Ven. Nārada 19-07) He who does not practise higher morality (sīla) and austerities (dhutāṅga).

.. [NāradaFn19-08] (Ven. Nārada 19-08) Bhikkhu, literally, means "he who begs" but bhikkhus do not beg. They silently stand at the door for alms. They live on what is spontaneously given by the supporters. See note on v. 31.

.. [NāradaFn19-09] (Ven. Nārada 19-09) Vissaṃ dhammaṃ = visamaṃ dhammaṃ, vissaṃ gandhaṃ vā kāyakammādikaṃ dhammaṃ (Commentary). Vissaṃ has two meanings (1) whole or all, and (2) bad smell. The Commentary gives only the latter in this case.

                    "He is not a mendicant simply because he begs others (for alms). He who adopts the whole law is a mendicant, not he who adopts only a part". Radhakrishnan.

                    The context makes the verse clear. The brahmin who had adopted the ascetic life claimed the right to be called a bhikkhu simply because he begged his food as is the custom of the disciples of the Buddha although he did not observe the other practices of a bhikkhu.

                    Vissaṃ dhammaṃ could therefore be interpreted as "the whole code of morality pertaining to the life of a bhikkhu".

.. [NāradaFn19-10] (Ven. Nārada 19-10) Such as morality, concentration, wisdom, etc.

.. [NāradaFn19-11] (Ven. Nārada 19-11) That is, for having embraced the best and abandoned evil.

.. [NāradaFn19-12] (Ven. Nārada 19-12) Internal and external Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn19-13] (Ven. Nārada 19-13) The four kinds of higher morality observed by bhikkhus and the thirteen kinds of higher ascetic practices (dhutāṅga) (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn19-14] (Ven. Nārada 19-14) That is, the Tipitaka (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn19-15] (Ven. Nārada 19-15) Anāgāmi stage (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn19-16] (Ven. Nārada 19-16) Faith in existence (Commentary). "Have a care", Mrs. Rhys Davids.

.. [NāradaFn19-17] (Ven. Nārada 19-17) That is, Arahantship.

.. [ThaniSFn-V256-257] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 256-257) The sense of the verse, confirmed by DhpA, suggests that the Pali word dhammattho means "judge." This, in fact, is the theme tying together the verses in this chapter. The duty of a judge is to correctly determine attha, a word that denotes both "meaning" and "judgment," these two senses of the word being connected by the fact that the judge must interpret the meanings of words used in rules and principles to see how they correctly apply to the particulars of a case so that he can pass a correct verdict. The remaining verses in this chapter give examples of interpreting attha in an appropriate way.

.. [ThaniSFn-V259] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 259) "Sees Dhamma through his body": The more common expression in the Pali Canon (e.g., in AN 6.46 and AN 9.45) is to touch Dhamma through or with the body (phusati or phassati, "he touches," rather than passati, "he sees"). The Sanskrit recensions and the Patna Dhp all support the reading, "he would touch," but all Pali recensions are unanimous in the reading, "he sees." Some scholars regard this latter reading as a corruption of the verse; I personally find it a more striking image than the common expression.

.. [ThaniSFn-V265] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 265) This verse plays with a number of nouns and verbs related to the adjective sama, which means "even," "equal," "on pitch," or "in tune." Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments, for good. Thus in Pali, samana, or contemplative, also means a person who is in tune with the principles of rightness and truth inherent in nature. Here and in 388, I've attempted to give a hint of these implications by associating the word "contemplative" with "consonance."

.. [ThaniSFn-V268-269] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 268-269) This verse contains the Buddhist refutation of the idea that "those who know don't speak, those who speak don't know." For another refutation of the same idea, see DN 12. In Vedic times, a sage (muni) was a person who took a vow of silence (mona) and was supposed to gain special knowledge as a result. The Buddhists adopted the term muni, but redefined it to show how true knowledge was attained and how it expressed itself in the sage's actions.

.. [ThaniSFn-V271-272] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 271-272) This verse has what seems to be a rare construction, in which na + instrumental nouns + a verb in the aorist tense gives the force of a prohibitive ("Don't, on account of x, do y"). "The renunciate ease that run-of-the-mill people don't know," according to DhpA, is the state of non-returning, the third of the four stages of Awakening (see note 22). Because non-returners are still attached to subtle states of becoming on the level of form and formlessness, DhpA drives home the message that even non-returners should not be complacent by paraphrasing a passage from AN 1 (202 in the Thai edition; at the end of Chapter 19 in the PTS edition) that reads, "Just as even a small amount of excrement is foul-smelling, in the same way I do not praise even a small amount of becoming, even for the extent of a fingersnap."

.. [VaradoFn-V266] (Ven. Varado V.266) Verse 266: "A bhikkhu is one who commits/ To the whole of the training, not bits" (vissaṃ dhammaṃ samādāya bhikkhu hoti na tāvatā). PED (vissaṃ): all, every, entire. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V256] (DLMBS Commentary V256) Some monks were returning from Sāvatthi after their almsround. Because there was a heavy rain, they took a shelter in a hall of justice. While there, they observed the judges deciding the cases very quickly after having taken bribes. 

    The monks later reported the matter to the Buddha who told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 257).

.. [DLMBSFn-V257] (DLMBS Commentary V257) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 257). 

    It is very easy to judge others, to point out others' mistakes or bad qualities. Therefore we have to be very thorough when we have to judge others. We have to listen to every possible point of view; we have to look at the problem from all angles. Only then can we be able to judge according to truth and we can call ourselves "righteous".

.. [DLMBSFn-V258] (DLMBS Commentary V258) A group of monks always caused troubles in the monastery. Wherever they went, some problems occurred. Once they boasted in front of some novices, saying only they were wise and intelligent. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he replied with this verse, saying that one should not be called wise only because one talks a lot. Only one who is peaceful and free from hate can be called wise.

.. [DLMBSFn-V259] (DLMBS Commentary V259) A monk named Ekudāna lived alone in the forest. He knew by heart only one verse of the Dharma, but he fully understood its meaning. Whenever he would recite the verse, the guardian spirits of the forest would applaud. 

    At one occasion, two learned monks with many disciples came to that place. They asked Ekudāna of there were many beings that wished to learn the Dharma. Ekudāna told them about the spirits applauding every time the Dharma was spoken. The two monks they took turns preaching the Dharma but when they finished, the guardian spirits did not applaud at all. Therefore they started to doubt Ekudāna’s words. But Ekudāna simply recited the verse he knew and immediately the spirits started to applaud. 

    The two monks returned to Sāvatthi and reported the matter to Buddha. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in understanding the Dharma, quality is much more important than quantity. To remember only one verse, but understanding it fully is far better than remembering all the Buddha’s words but not actually grasping their meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V260] (DLMBS Commentary V260) A group of monks came to see the Buddha. Because he knew they were very close to attaining the Awakenment, he asked them if they had seen an Elder just entering the room. The monks replied they did not see an Elder, only a young novice. The Buddha replied that this monk was actually not a novice, but an Elder. He further told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 261). 

    The monks all attained the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V261] (DLMBS Commentary V261) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 260). 

    Wisdom cannot be measured by age. One who is old is not necessarily wise. Sometimes a young person can be far wiser than somebody old. To grow old is not a virtue demanding automatic respect. We should save our respect for those who deserve it. People, who understand the Buddha's teaching deeply, and act accordingly, are to be respected, be they young or old.

.. [DLMBSFn-V262] (DLMBS Commentary V262) The elder monks usually had some young novices as their students. It was custom that these novices would attend on their teachers, wash their robes, get water for them to drink and other small services. Some monks who had no students started to envy these elders. So they suggested to the Buddha that the novices should have more teachers to receive more guidance. Of course, the Buddha knew their real motive (to get some work done by the novices) so he refused this. He further admonished the monks by this verse (and the following one, DhP 263).

.. [DLMBSFn-V263] (DLMBS Commentary V263) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 262). 

    One, who wants to be respected, should discard all the impurities and clean one's mind. It is not possible to be envious, hating and selfish and expect others to respect us. To try to hide it away under the mask of nice words and smiling face maybe can fool somebody, but only for a short while. Then everybody will see the true face and their respect for us will quickly evaporate.

.. [DLMBSFn-V264] (DLMBS Commentary V264) There was a monk named Hatthaka. He liked to argue with others. If he was defeated in an argument, he challenged his opponent to meet again at a specified place and time. Hatthaka would get to the place before the appointed time and would declare that the absence of his opponent means he acknowledges his defeat. Therefore he would boast he won the argument.
    When the Buddha heard about this, he admonished Hatthaka by this verse (and the following one, DhP 265).

.. [DLMBSFn-V265] (DLMBS Commentary V265) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 264). 

    To be a monk is not easy. Just to wear the monk's robe and have one's head shaven is certainly not enough. If a monk lacks discipline and resolve, then he is not to be called a monk. Only after having met and conquered evils, greed, desire and others, and with firm self-discipline, is one truly a monk.

.. [DLMBSFn-V266] (DLMBS Commentary V266) There was a brahmin, who had the habit of going on almsround begging for almsfood, just as the Buddha's monks did. Therefore, he thought he was also to be called a monk. He went to see the Buddha and told him this idea. The Buddha reprimanded him with this verse (and the following one, DhP 267).

.. [DLMBSFn-V267] (DLMBS Commentary V267) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 266). 

    A true monk is not the one who wears monk's robes and gets his almsfood from people, but his heart is full of worldly things. Only one, who leads a moral life and has a deep insight into the reality of things, can be called a monk. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V268] (DLMBS Commentary V268) At the Buddha's times there were many ascetic orders. Some of them went for almsfood just like the Buddha's monks. After being offered food, some of them would say a few words of blessing; such as "May you be well and happy, may you live long." The Buddha's monks were at first instructed to keep silent. 

    Some followers of the Buddha began to complain about that and wanted to hear some blessing also from the Buddha's monks. The Buddha then instructed his monks to do so, in order to keep lay followers happy. 

    Then some other ascetics, who kept silence after being offered food, said that the Buddha's monks were not true sages (muni) because they did not keep the vow of silence in public (mona). 

    The Buddha reacted with this verse (and the following one, DhP 269).

.. [DLMBSFn-V269] (DLMBS Commentary V269) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 268). 

    Silence does not necessarily mean wisdom. Sometimes one can keep silent only because one has nothing to say, or out of stupidity and not understanding what is going on. One who understands the reality of this world and the next one, who does not cling to anything and has discarded evil, can be truly called a sage.

.. [DLMBSFn-V270] (DLMBS Commentary V270) There was a fisherman named Ariya living in Sāvatthi. Once while he was fishing, the Buddha and some monks went around. Ariya got up and paid his respects to the Buddha, who asked him about his name. When replied, the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that he was not worthy to be called Ariya ("Noble")  if he harmed living beings. 

    Ariya understood and attained the first level of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V271] (DLMBS Commentary V271) There were many monks who were practicing the Dharma. Not all of them had reached the Awakenment quickly. Once a group of monks came to see the Buddha. Some of them had observed the rules perfectly and were very virtuous. Others studied a lot of the Buddha's discourses and yet others were good in meditation. 

    The Buddha asked them if they had attained the Awakenment. They replied that they did not but that it should be easy, since they had achieved so much already. The Buddha replied with this verse (and the following one, DhP 272).

.. [DLMBSFn-V272] (DLMBS Commentary V272) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 271). 

    To attain the Awakenment is not easy. We should not compare it to other tasks. Even if we have attained some spiritual progress, like good concentration of mind, if we have learned a lot of Sutras, or if we are truly moral and spiritual people - in comparison with the ultimate goal these tasks are very easy indeed. Only when we have reached the final goal and eradicated all the taints from our minds, then we can finally be content and say that we have done what had to be done.

.. [NāradaFn20-01] (Ven. Nārada 20-01) The Eightfold Path is the Middle Way discovered by the Buddha for the realization of Nibbāna. It consists of: right understanding(sammā diññhi), right thoughts (sammā saṅkappa), right speech (sammā vācā), right action (sammā kammanta), right livelihood (sammā ājīva), right effort (sammā vāyāma), right mindfulness (sammā sati), and right concentration (sammā samādhi).

                    This is the unique path of Enlightenment. From a philosophical stand-point these eight factors are the eight mental states found in the supramundane consciousness which has Nibbāna for its object.

.. [NāradaFn20-02] (Ven. Nārada 20-02) They are the four Noble Truths - suffering, the cause of suffering, the destruction of suffering, and the path leading to the destruction of suffering. The first truth of suffering is to be comprehended, the cause of suffering (which is craving) is to be eradicated, the destruction of suffering (which is Nibbāna) is to be realized, the path leading to the destruction of suffering (which is the Eightfold Path) is to be developed. Whether the Buddhas arise or not these four truths exist in the world. It is the Buddhas that reveal them to mankind.

.. [NāradaFn20-03] (Ven. Nārada 20-03) Virāga = Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn20-04] (Ven. Nārada 20-04) Of lust etc.

.. [NāradaFn20-05] (Ven. Nārada 20-05) That is, to control passions in order to realize Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn20-06] (Ven. Nārada 20-06) When the Buddha refers to Himself He employs the term Tathāgata which means "who thus hath come".

.. [NāradaFn20-07] (Ven. Nārada 20-07) Saṅkhāra is a multisignificant term. Here it is used in the sense of things conditioned by causes. Supermundane Nibbāna is not included in saṅkhāra as it is not conditioned by any cause. It is causeless and timeless.

.. [NāradaFn20-08] (Ven. Nārada 20-08) Suffering caused by attending to the five Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn20-09] (Ven. Nārada 20-09) Impermanence (anicca), sorrow (dukkha) and no-soul (anatta) are the three characteristics of all things conditioned by causes. It is by contemplating them that one realizes Nibbāna. The aspirant may choose any characteristic that appeals to him most.

                     Anattā or no-soul is the crux of Buddhism. The term saṅkhāra which is applied to any conditioned thing is used in the two previous verses, while in the third verse the term dhamma is used. The commentator interprets dhamma as the "aggregates" (khandhā). The same interpretation he gives to saṅkhāra too. If by dhamma is meant saṅkhāra, there is no reason for the Buddha to make a differentiation in the third verse.

                     Saṅkhāra is applied only to those things conditioned by causes. Dhamma can be applied to both conditioned and unconditioned things and states. It embraces both conditioned and unconditioned things including Nibbāna. In order to show that even Nibbāna is free from a permanent soul the Buddha used the term dhamma in the third verse. Nibbāna is a positive supramundane state and is without a soul.

                     "All the elements of being are non-self. When one by wisdom realizes (this), he heeds not (is superior to) (this world of) sorrow, this is the path to purity". Radhakrishnan.

.. [NāradaFn20-10] (Ven. Nārada 20-10) Saṃsannasaṅkappamano literally, mind with right thoughts depressed.

.. [NāradaFn20-11] (Ven. Nārada 20-11) Here vana means forest of such passions as lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn20-12] (Ven. Nārada 20-12) When the Buddha said, "Cut down the forest", some newly ordained monks erroneously gave the expression its literal meaning. The Buddha, reading their thoughts, corrected them, stating that what he meant was not actual trees but passions.

.. [NāradaFn20-13] (Ven. Nārada 20-13) Vana means big trees and vanatha means smaller trees. Here vana means the powerful passions and vanatha means the lesser passions.

.. [NāradaFn20-14] (Ven. Nārada 20-14) Having eradicated all passions by means of the four Paths, be passionless.

.. [BudRkFn-v283] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 283) The meaning of this injunction is: "Cut down the forest of lust, but do not mortify the body."

.. [ThaniSFn-V273] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 273) The four truths: stress, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation (which is identical to the eightfold path). See note 191.

.. [ThaniSFn-V275] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 275) "I have taught you this path": reading akkhato vo maya maggo with the Thai edition, a reading supported by the Patna Dhp. "Having known — for your knowing": two ways of interpreting what is apparently a play on the Pali word, aññaya, which can be either be the gerund of ajanati or the dative of añña. On the extraction of arrows as a metaphor for the practice, see MN 63 and MN 105.

.. [ThaniSFn-V285] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 285) Although the first word in this verse, ucchinda, literally means "crush," "destroy," "annihilate," I have found no previous English translation that renders it accordingly. Most translate it as "cut out" or "uproot," which weakens the image. On the role played by self-allure in leading the heart to become fixated on others, see AN 7.48.

.. [ThaniSFn-V288] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 288) Ender = death.

.. [VaradoFn-V275] (Ven. Varado V.275) Verse 275: The sting of the arrow I’ve known/ And, to you, the appeasement (santhanaṃ) I’ve shown. PED (santhana): appeasing.  

.. [VaradoFn-V285] (Ven. Varado V.285) Verse 285: "crush (ucchinda) an exquisite carnation". PED (ucchindati): destroy.

.. [DLMBSFn-V273] (DLMBS Commentary V273) Once the Buddha with a group of monks returned to the Jetavana monastery after a teaching trip. In the evening, some monks talked about the trip, about the condition of the path, about the nature of the land, whether it was hilly or flat etc. 

    The Buddha entered the hall where they were talking and told them this verse (and the following ones, DhP 274, DhP 275 and DhP 276), saying that such talks were ultimately meaningless.

.. [DLMBSFn-V274] (DLMBS Commentary V274) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 273) and the following ones (DhP 275 and DhP 276). 
    The Eightfold path is said to be the only way to reach the Awakenment. It means, we have to follow all the eight constituents of the Path in order to be able to purify the mind and attain the Nirvana. What are the eight constituents of the Eightfold path? They are Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.

.. [DLMBSFn-V275] (DLMBS Commentary V275) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 273, DhP 274) and the following one (DhP 276). 

    The Buddha taught the teaching that he personally discovered. He taught from his own experience. He found out how to "remove the arrow", or how to end the suffering. He then proclaimed this path for everyone to follow. By doing so, we are able to do what the Buddha did - to put an end to suffering forever.

.. [DLMBSFn-V276] (DLMBS Commentary V276) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 273, DhP 274 and DhP 275). 

    The Buddha found the way to make an end to suffering. He taught it to us. But we have to make the effort. Nobody will do it for us. We cannot wait for a teacher to pull us from the swamp by some miracle. Only by diligent meditation and daily practice can we be released from the bond of Mara, from the world of suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V277] (DLMBS Commentary V277) Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive the impermanence of things. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on its meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V278] (DLMBS Commentary V278) Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive the unsatisfactoriness of conditioned things. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on its meaning

.. [DLMBSFn-V279] (DLMBS Commentary V279) Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive that all things are without a self. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on its meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V280] (DLMBS Commentary V280) A group of young men became monks. They all received a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to the forest to practice meditation. But one of them, named Tissa, stayed behind in the monastery and did not meditate diligently. 

    The monks who practiced meditation all attained Awakenment and came back to the monastery to pay their respects to the Buddha. When Tissa saw that all of his friends were now Arahants, he regretted that he wasted his time. He decided to try very hard and started to meditate throughout the night. While he was practicing walking meditation he slipped and broke his leg. When the Buddha heard about this he spoke this verse, saying that we should exert while we can.

.. [DLMBSFn-V281] (DLMBS Commentary V281) Venerable Moggallāna once went on an alms-round with Venerable Lakkhana. Suddenly Moggallāna smiled, because he saw a hungry ghost (*peta*) with the head of a pig and a human body. Later Lakkhana asked Moggallāna why he smiled. Moggallāna told him about the *peta*.

    The Buddha overheard that and told them that he himself saw the same *peta*. He then related the *peta*'s story. Once he was a famous monk who was very good at expounding the Dharma. Once he came to a monastery, where two friend monks stayed. After a while he realized that he liked the place very much. There was plenty of good food and the lay followers liked his way of expounding the Dharma. So he decided to make the two monks go away and keep the place just for himself. He set one friend against the other. They quarreled and left away. 

    Because of this the monk suffered for a long time. He had to be born as a hungry ghost. The Buddha finished his story by this verse, saying that we should always guard our actions bodily, verbal and mental.

.. [DLMBSFn-V282] (DLMBS Commentary V282) There was a monk name Pothila. He knew the Dharma very well and taught it to many followers. But he did not practice meditation and was conceited. The Buddha wanted to put him on the right path and therefore called him "useless Pothila". Pothila reflected on those words and realized what did the Buddha mean. So he went to the senior monk and humbly asked to be his pupil. But the monk sent him to the next senior monk. This happened several times until Pothila ended up as a pupil of a young novice (who was an Arahant). 

    He followed the meditation instructions diligently and was no longer conceited because of his theoretical mastery of the Dharma. The Buddha saw his effort and told him this verse. Soon after, Pothila reached the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V283] (DLMBS Commentary V283) In the city of Sāvatthi there lived five friends. When they became old, they all went forth and became monks. But they had the habit of going to their old homes for almsfood. Especially a former wife of one of them was a very good cook. So they went to her house often and she looked after them. But one day, this old lady fell sick and died. The five friends wept and lamented, praising her virtues. 

    The Buddha overheard this and told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 284), saying that sorrow comes from ignorance, greed and hatred. Especially in this case, greed was the main factor. So he taught them to cut off "the forest" of greed and passions in order to be free from sorrow.

.. [DLMBSFn-V284] (DLMBS Commentary V284) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 283). 

    Greed or passion is one of the three main roots of evil. Due to the underlying ignorance, we feel passion and hatred, like and dislike. Because of that we do things with the mind bound with passion or hatred. Therefore we create karma that keeps us in the circle of life and death. Only when we cut off these passions and dissolve ignorance, can we stop creating karmically good and bad deeds and be free from suffering, with a free mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V285] (DLMBS Commentary V285) Venerable Sāriputta had a young monk as a pupil. This monk was a son of a goldsmith. Sāriputta gave him a subject of meditation (impurity of the body) and the monk went to the forest to practice meditation. But he did not make any progress and kept returning to Sāriputta to ask for more instructions. So Sāriputta took him to see the Buddha. 

    The Buddha changed the tactics. He gave the monk a beautiful lotus. He told him to put it in front of himself and meditate on its purity and beauty. The monk did so and was able to reach unbroken concentration and achieve the fourth level of mental absorption (**jhāna**). 

    At that moment the Buddha made the lotus to wither. The monk saw this and 
    realized the impermanence of all things. The Buddha then further exhorted him with this verse. The monk reflected on its meaning and attained the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V286] (DLMBS Commentary V286) Mahādhana was a merchant from Benares. Once he came to Sāvatthi during a festival, hoping to sell his goods. But on the way he was stopped by a flood and could not cross the river for seven days. Thus the festival ended before he even got there. 

    Mahādhana decided to stay in Sāvatthi for some time and sell his goods slowly. Once the Buddha saw him and smiled. Ānanda asked him about the reason for his smile. The Buddha replied that Mahādhana is not aware of his impeding death and thinks he can stay in Sāvatthi comfortably, sell his goods and then return home. 

    Ānanda then advised Mahādhana to listen to the Buddha's sermons and to practice mindfulness. Mahādhana was alarmed when he heard that he was about to die. For seven days he gave alms to the Buddha and monks and listened to the Dharma. After hearing this verse from the Buddha, he attained the first stage of Awakenment. After he died he was reborn in the Tusita heaven.

.. [DLMBSFn-V287] (DLMBS Commentary V287) Kisā Gotami came to see the Buddha after her only son died. The Buddha told her this verse in order to calm her down. See DhP 114 for the whole story.

.. [DLMBSFn-V288] (DLMBS Commentary V288) Paṭācārā lost her husband, two sons, parents and the only brother almost at the same time. She grieved so much that she went almost crazy. When she came to see the Buddha, he told her this verse (and the following one, DhP 289) to calm her down. For the whole story see DhP 113.

.. [DLMBSFn-V289] (DLMBS Commentary V289) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 288). 

    The only help and protection against the death is constant and intensive practice of the Buddha’s teaching. No external help from relatives, friends or gods of any kind is possible when we have to face the death. Only by following the path of meditation and awareness, can we overcome death and face it without any fear.

.. [NāradaFn21-01] (Ven. Nārada 21-01) Observance of morality, practise of meditation, etc.

.. [NāradaFn21-02] (Ven. Nārada 21-02) Such as decoration of umbrellas, sandals bowls, belts, etc.

.. [NāradaFn21-03] (Ven. Nārada 21-03) Contemplation on the loathsomeness of the body.

.. [NāradaFn21-04] (Ven. Nārada 21-04) Mātā = (mother) represents craving (taṇhā) as it produces birth.

.. [NāradaFn21-05] (Ven. Nārada 21-05) Pitā = (father) represents "I-conceit".

.. [NāradaFn21-06] (Ven. Nārada 21-06) Sānucaraṃ = (revenue officer) here represents clinging to life (nandirāga).

.. [NāradaFn21-07] (Ven. Nārada 21-07) Veyyagghapañcamaṃ, this term is used to denote the five hindrances (nīvaraṇa) of which doubt or indecision (vicikicchā) is the fifth. Veyyaggha means a perilous path infested with tigers. Doubt is comparable to such a path (Commentary). The other four hindrances are: sense-desire (kāmacchanda), ill-will (vyāpāda), restlessness and brooding (uddhacca-kukkucca), and slot and torpor (thīna-middha). They are called hindrances because they obstruct the path to heavenly bliss and Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn21-08] (Ven. Nārada 21-08) Reflection on the virtues of the Buddha, the Enlightened One.

.. [NāradaFn21-09] (Ven. Nārada 21-09) Reflection on the virtues of the Dhamma, the Teaching (of the Enlightened One).

.. [NāradaFn21-10] (Ven. Nārada 21-10) Reflection on the virtues of the Sangha, the Noble Order of Disciples (of the Enlightened One).

.. [NāradaFn21-11] (Ven. Nārada 21-11) Contemplation on the loathsomeness of the body.

.. [NāradaFn21-12] (Ven. Nārada 21-12) Saddhā trustful confidence based on knowledge. Buddhism has no place for blind faith.

.. [ThaniSFn-V293] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 293) Mindfulness immersed in the body = the practice of focusing on the body at all times simply as a phenomenon in and of itself, as a way of developing meditative absorption (jhana) and removing any sense of attraction to, distress over, or identification with the body. MN 119 lists the following practices as instances of mindfulness immersed in the body: mindfulness of breathing, awareness of the four postures of the body (standing, sitting, walking, lying down), alertness to all the actions of the body, analysis of the body into its 32 parts, analysis of it into its four properties (earth, water, fire, wind), and contemplation of the body's inevitable decomposition after death.

.. [ThaniSFn-V294] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 294) This verse and the one following it use terms with ambiguous meanings to shock the listener. According to DhpA, mother = craving; father = conceit; two warrior kings = views of eternalism (that one has an identity remaining constant through all time) and of annihilationism (that one is totally annihilated at death); kingdom = the twelve sense spheres (the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, feeling, and ideation, together with their respective objects); dependency = passions for the sense spheres.

.. [ThaniSFn-V295] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 295) DhpA: two learned kings = views of eternalism and annihilationism; a tiger = the path where the tiger goes for food, i.e., the hindrance of uncertainty, or else all five hindrances (sensual desire, ill will, torpor & lethargy, restlessness & anxiety, and uncertainty). However, in Sanskrit literature, "tiger" is a term for a powerful and eminent man; if that is what is meant here, the term may stand for anger.

.. [ThaniSFn-V299] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 299) See note 293.

.. [ThaniSFn-V301] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 301) "Developing the mind" in terms of the 37 Wings to Awakening: the four frames of reference (ardent, mindful alertness to body, feelings, mind states, and mental qualities in and of themselves), the four right exertions (to abandon and avoid evil, unskillful mental qualities, and to foster and strengthen skillful mental qualities), the four bases of power (concentration based on desire, persistence, intentness, and discrimination), the five strengths and five faculties (conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment), the seven factors for self-awakening (see note 89), and the noble eightfold path (see note 191). For a full treatment of this topic, see The Wings to Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V303] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 303) DhpA: Wealth = both material wealth and the seven forms of noble wealth (ariya-dhana): conviction, virtue, shame, compunction (at the thought of doing evil), erudition, generosity, discernment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V290] (DLMBS Commentary V290) Once there was a serious drought in Vesāli. It was followed by a famine and an epidemic of diseases. People of Vesāli tried many ways to ease this situation but nothing seemed to work. Finally, they sent messengers to the Buddha, asking him to go to Vesāli. The Buddha accepted. 

    As soon as he with a large group of monks reached Vesāli there was a heavy rainfall, which cleaned the city. The Buddha recited a text called Ratana Sutta and instructed the monks to go around the city and recite the same text for seven days. After seven days, everything in Vesāli returned to normal. People of the city were very grateful to the Buddha and since that day, the Buddha had a large group of followers in Vesāli. The Ratana Sutta is used for protection even today.

.. [DLMBSFn-V291] (DLMBS Commentary V291) Once there lived a woman who kept a hen. The hen would lay one egg every day and the woman would break it and eat it. The hen was very angry because of that and started hating the woman. As a result of his, they were always reborn together causing pain to each other. 

    During the time of the Buddha, one of them was born as a woman and the other one as an ogress. Once the woman with her husband and son were on their way home from a visit to relatives. Her husband went to take a bath and she rested with her son by the roadside. At that moment, the ogress appeared and attacked her. The woman took her son and ran to the monastery for refuge. 

    There the Buddha told them the whole story and asked them to stop hating each other, for otherwise they would never be free. He told them this verse to make them understand his meaning. Both of them realized the futility of hatred and agreed not to harm each other from then on.

.. [DLMBSFn-V292] (DLMBS Commentary V292) In Bhaddiya there was a monastery with many monks. There was a sort of competition amongst these monks: who will make more beautiful ornamental slippers to wear. As a result of this, they neglected their meditation and they made no progress in spiritual matters. 

    The matter was reported to the Buddha who admonished the monks from Bhaddiya. He told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 293). The monks realized the error of their ways and from that time on strove diligently to reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V293] (DLMBS Commentary V293) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 292). 

    These two verses are reminding us that we should not loose the vision of the final goal. If we spend most of our time trying to make "more and more beautiful slippers", then we have no time to practice in order to reach the goal. Only by diligently putting all of our effort into the practice, by staying mindful all of the time, can we hope to erase our taints and reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V294] (DLMBS Commentary V294) Once a group of monks visited the Buddha. While they were paying their respects, the monk Lakunṭaka Bhaddiya, who was an Arahant, passed by. The Buddha told the monks this verse (and the following one, DhP 295). He told the monks to look at Lakunṭaka Bhaddiya: he was a monk who has killed his parents, and kings, indeed the whole country; and yet he was walking calmly, without remorse. 

    The monks could not understand what the Buddha was talking about! Surely this Arahant had killed nobody! Then the Buddha had to explain: "mother" means craving, "father" is conceit, "two warrior kings" are views of eternalism and nihilism, "the country" are sense-organs and sense-objects and the "followers" are attachment and lust.

.. [DLMBSFn-V295] (DLMBS Commentary V295) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP 294). 

    Here, the Brahmin kings are a simile for two extreme views. The "tiger as fifth" is taken to mean the five mental hindrances. These are: sense-desire (**kāmacchanda**), ill-will (**vyāpāda**), sloth and torpor (**thīna-middha**), restlessness and scruples (**uddhacca-kukkucca**) and skeptical doubt (**vicikicchā**).

.. [DLMBSFn-V296] (DLMBS Commentary V296) In the city of Rājagaha there lived a woodcutter. One day he took he and his son went to the forest to cut some wood. On the way back they stopped by a cemetery and ate their meal. While they were eating, their two oxen wandered away from them. When they realized this, the father went to search for the oxen and told the son to stay with the cart. The father found the oxen on the city but by that time the city gates were closed and he could not leave the city. 

    The boy stayed outside by himself. He crawled under the cart and slept. At night, two spirits came and tried to frighten him. The boy cried, "I pay homage to the Buddha". The spirits immediately felt they had to protect the boy. One of them went to the palace of King Bimbisāra and brought the king's food tray full of food. The boy ate and then slept until morning. The spirits left a message for the king written on the food tray (but only the king could read it). 

    In the morning the king's servants started to look for the tray. Finally they found it with the boy. They thought he stole it therefore they took him to the king. The king found the note on the tray and realized that this case was not easy. The boy kept telling them his parents came to him in the sleep and fed him. The king then sent for his parents who said they slept at home. 

    The king decided and took all of them to see the Buddha. The Buddha explained what happened. The king then asked if mindfulness directed to the Buddha is the only way to guard against danger. The Buddha further explained by six verses (this one and the following five, DhP 297 - DhP 301) that mindfulness in general is the way to guard against danger.

.. [DLMBSFn-V297] (DLMBS Commentary V297) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 296) and the four following ones (DhP 298 - DhP 301). 

    Recollection of the qualities of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha is one of the most favorite meditation subjects in the meditation of insight (**vipassanā**).

.. [DLMBSFn-V298] (DLMBS Commentary V298) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 296, DhP 297) and the following ones (DhP 299 - DhP 301).

.. [DLMBSFn-V299] (DLMBS Commentary V299) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 296, DhP 297 and DhP 298) and the following ones (DhP 300 and DhP 301). 

    This is perhaps the most important and most usual form of meditation - mindfulness of the body. We are trying to be mindful of all bodily movements, of breath, of every posture and intentions to move. There is one whole text in the Pali Buddhist Canon (**Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta**) dealing with this meditation.

.. [DLMBSFn-V300] (DLMBS Commentary V300) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 296, DhP 297, DhP 298 and DhP 299) and the following one (DhP 301). 

    Non-violence is also one very important factor in Buddhist meditation. Active non-violence is also called **mettā** (loving-kindness). We should practice the meditation of loving-kindness at the end of every meditation session.

.. [DLMBSFn-V301] (DLMBS Commentary V301) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 296 - DhP 300). 

    The forms of meditation described in the previous five verses are the most important in Buddhist practice. By following all of them, by devoting our minds to meditation day and night, we can truly hope to achieve the Awakenment and be free from suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V302] (DLMBS Commentary V302) Once there was a big festival in Vesāli. The city was lit up and full of happy people, everybody was singing and dancing. A young monk in the monastery saw the festival from a distance and felt dissatisfied with his life as a monk. He complained aloud that he has the worst lot in the whole world. At that instant, a guardian spirit appeared and told the monk that as those in hells envy those in heaven, so do people from the city envy the monks in the forest. The monk realized the truth. 

    In the morning he told this story to the Buddha, who admonished him with this verse, further adding that the monk should reflect on the impermanence and pain in the lives of all beings.

.. [DLMBSFn-V303] (DLMBS Commentary V303) Venerable Sāriputta had a lay disciple named Citta. Although he was not a monk he attained the third level of Awakenment. Once he came to Sāvatthi in order to pay his respects to the Buddha. He came with a caravan, many carts loaded with food and other goods. He stayed in the monastery many days, continually making offerings to the Buddha and monks. But still his goods did not diminish one bit. 

    The day before he had to leave for his hometown, Citta offered all of his goods to the Community. But his carts were immediately full again! The gods filled them up with various priceless things. Venerable Ānanda reported this to the Buddha. He replied with this verse, saying that somebody as Citta will be revered wherever he goes.

.. [DLMBSFn-V304] (DLMBS Commentary V304) Anātha Piṇḍika and Ugga both studied under the same teacher while they were young. Later Anātha Piṇḍika had a daughter and Ugga had a son. When the children grew up, their parents arranged their marriage. The daughter of Anātha Piṇḍika, named Cūla Subhaddā went to live with her husband and parents-in-law. 

    Ugga and his family were not followers of the Buddha, but they were disciples of different ascetic school (called "naked ascetics", because the monks did not wear any clothes). Cūla Subhaddā told her mother-in-law about the Buddha and she was anxious to see him. She agreed to invite the Buddha for the almsfood the next day. Because the Jetavana monastery was far away, Cūla Subhaddā made the invitation only with her heart. But the Buddha knew and accepted the invitation. 

    At that day, Anātha Piṇḍika went to the monastery and invited the Buddha to have almsfood in his house the next day. But the Buddha replied that he had already accepted Cūla Subhaddā's invitation. Anātha Piṇḍika asked how was it possible if his daughter lived so far away. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the good ones can be seen and heard from far away. 

    The next day, the Buddha with many monks went to the house of Ugga. After the meal, he delivered a discourse. The whole Ugga's family became followers of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V305] (DLMBS Commentary V305) Venerable Ekavihāri used to live alone, eat alone and meditating in solitude. He did not like to keep company of other monks. Some monks did not understand why he did so and reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha praised Ekavihāri and spoke this verse about how good it is for a monk to concentrate on meditation in seclusion.

.. [NāradaFn22-01] (Ven. Nārada 22-01) Saṅkassaraṃ = to think or remember with suspicion.

.. [NāradaFn22-02] (Ven. Nārada 22-02) The birth of a Buddha, a congenial habitation, a healthy body, the possession of right views, etc.

.. [NāradaFn22-03] (Ven. Nārada 22-03) Nigaṇñha, literally, "free from ties or bonds" is the term applied to Jaina ascetics, who, according to this story, cover their pudenda. Acelaka ascetics wander completely naked.

.. [NāradaFn22-04] (Ven. Nārada 22-04) Avajja means right belief and vajja means wrong belief.

.. [VaradoFn-V315] (Ven. Varado V.315) Verse 315: "Do not miss the opportunity (khano)". PED (khano): opportunity, as well as moment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V306] (DLMBS Commentary V306) The Buddha had many followers. Some of them had been disciples of other teachers and came to the Buddha after hearing and realizing the Dharma. The other teachers did not much like this and some of them came up with a plan. 

    They instructed a young woman named Sundarī to make it appear as if she had an affair with the Buddha. In the evening, she would go in the direction of the monastery and in the morning return from that direction to the city. To anyone interested she would say that she is the Buddha's mistress. Then the plotters hired some killers to kill Sundarī and dumped her body near the Buddha's monastery. 

    The body was found and the plotters started to go around the city, saying that not only the Buddha had a mistress; he also killed her when the fact became known. The Buddha remained calm, he just replied with this verse. 

    The king decided to investigate the matter further. Thus his men learned about the hired killers. When these were arrested, they admitted to being hired by the evil plotters. They were made to go around the city, proclaiming their own crime and the Buddha's complete innocence in the matter. The fame of the Buddha was much enhanced and he had even more followers than before.

.. [DLMBSFn-V307] (DLMBS Commentary V307) Venerable Moggallāna once saw a group of hungry spirits (**peta**). When he returned to the monastery, he asked the Buddha about the spirits. The Buddha said that these were monks a long time ago. But they did not pay any attention to their spiritual development and committed a lot of evil deeds. Because of that, they were suffering in hell for a long period of time and now were still reborn in a woeful state. 

    The Buddha then added this verse, saying that if a monk does not take the monkshood seriously, he can expect bad results.

.. [DLMBSFn-V308] (DLMBS Commentary V308) Once there was a famine. In order to have enough food, some monks pretended in front of lay followers that they have attained Arahantship. The lay followers offered them only the best food, leaving almost nothing for themselves. 

    At the end of the Rain Retreat, the monks went to see the Buddha. Whereas all the other monks were pale and undernourished, this group was very healthy and fat. The Buddha asked them how that was possible. They told him what happened. The Buddha spoke this verse, saying that for a monk to pretend some level of attainment was one of the worst things to do.

.. [DLMBSFn-V309] (DLMBS Commentary V309) The famous benefactor Anātha Piṇḍika had a nephew named Khema. He was not only very rich, but also very handsome. Women fell attracted to him and Khema committed adultery often. He was caught several times, but the king did not take any actions against him, out of respect for his uncle. When Anātha Piṇḍika found out, he took Khema to see the Buddha. The Buddha spoke this verse (and the following one, Dhp 310) enumerating the bad results of adultery. Khema changed his behavior and observed the code of morality, the Five Precepts.

.. [DLMBSFn-V310] (DLMBS Commentary V310) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 309).

.. [DLMBSFn-V311] (DLMBS Commentary V311) There was a monk who once unintentionally cut of some plants. He felt very remorseful and confessed to another monk his offence. This second monk just laughed at him, saying that cutting of plants is only a very minor offence. To show, what he felt about it, this monk started to uproot plants around him. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he advised this monk by this verse (and two following one, DhP 312 and DhP 313) not to think little of minor rules. Plants are also living beings and should not be destroyed without reason. At first, the monk was obstinate, but later he realized the importance of the monk's precepts. Thereafter he followed the moral code strictly and practiced the meditation diligently. Later he attained the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V312] (DLMBS Commentary V312) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 311) and the following one (DhP 313). 

    Again, we are reminded, that the life of a monk is not easy. We should not think it to be very undemanding. This life is very difficult and full of hardships. A monk must endure them all, without trying to bend the rules of monastic conduct. Only then will the monastic life bear the ultimate fruit - the attainment of Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V313] (DLMBS Commentary V313) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses (DhP 311, DhP 312). 

    When one becomes a monk, it is because "there is something to be done". The task is - the complete liberation from the cycle of rebirths. All the energy should be applied to this task. If a monk is lax, there is no progress possible. The only result will be "heaping up" of more and more "dust" - hindrances and obstacles on the way to this final goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V314] (DLMBS Commentary V314) In Sāvatthi there lived a very jealous woman. She found out that her husband was having an affair with her maid. So one day she tied up the maid, cut off her ears and nose and locked her up in a room. Then she accompanied her husband to the Jetavana monastery. 

    The relatives of the maid immediately found out what happened. They freed her and took her to see the Buddha. The maid told the whole congregation (where the woman with her husband were also present) what had happened. The Buddha admonished the woman with this verse, saying that it is better not to do any kind of evil, not even in secret - because everything will be known at the end. The woman realized her mistakes and strove to uproot her jealousy.

.. [DLMBSFn-V315] (DLMBS Commentary V315) Some monks were staying at the border city. At the beginning the people of the city took good care of them and provided them with all the necessities. But later some bandits attacked the city, plundered it and took many citizens away. As a result, the city had to be rebuilt and the people did not have enough to look after the monks as much as before. 

    After some time, the monks went to see the Buddha and told him the story. The Buddha told them they should not be greedy and be satisfied with a little. He further admonished them with this verse, saying that just like the citizens guarded their city, so a monk should be always on guard and practice earnestly.

.. [DLMBSFn-V316] (DLMBS Commentary V316) A group of monks once saw some naked ascetics on their almsround. They were naked but they had their bowls covered with a piece of cloth. The monks remarked that perhaps they should put the cloth on the front part of the body. The naked ascetics retorted that they cover their bowls because they do not want insect and miniature life-form to enter the bowl and be killed by them later. 

    The monks returned to the monastery and told the story to the Buddha. The Buddha reacted with this verse (and the following one, DhP 317), saying that one who is ashamed of what is not shameful, but not ashamed of a shameful thing, surely will undergo a bad rebirth.

.. [DLMBSFn-V317] (DLMBS Commentary V317) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (DhP 316). 

    We should be ashamed and afraid of things that are truly bad. Causing suffering to others in any way is bad and we should be always ashamed and afraid of doing so. 

    On the other hand, being afraid and ashamed of something that is not bad at all (as for example the naked ascetics from the story) will not help us in any way on the road to the Awakenment. Thus we will only accumulate demerit and suffer a bad rebirth in the next life.

.. [DLMBSFn-V318] (DLMBS Commentary V318) All members of a certain family in Sāvatthi were followers of an ascetic. They did not want their children to mix with the Buddha's followers' children. They specifically forbade their children to go to the Jetavana monastery. 

    But once all the children were playing in the vicinity of the monastery and got thirsty. They asked one of their friends, whose parents were followers of the Buddha, to go to the monastery and bring them some water. The boy went inside and paid his respects to the Buddha. He told him about his friends who were not allowed to enter. 

    The Buddha invited the children in to have a drink and gave them a discourse. At the end, the children became his followers. 

    When they came home, they told their parents what happened. The parents were very angry and accused their children of disloyalty. But the neighbors, who were the followers of the Buddha, were able to change their view gradually and before long the whole family converted to the Buddha's teaching. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 319).

.. [DLMBSFn-V319] (DLMBS Commentary V319) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 318). 

    In order to ascertain a good future existence, both in this life and in the next one, we must always understand and distinguish right from wrong, good from bad. We also must use our understanding and insight to be able to decide which is which. Without this understanding we might choose wrongly and believe the good to be bad and vice versa. In this way, our future existence will not be good.

.. [NāradaFn23-01] (Ven. Nārada 23-01) Dantena by sense-control.

.. [NāradaFn23-02] (Ven. Nārada 23-02) Sudantena by the development of the Noble Path.

.. [NāradaFn23-03] (Ven. Nārada 23-03) Sahāyatā. By this term are meant morality, austere practices, insight, Paths, Fruits and Nibbāna. (Commentary) See v. 61.

.. [NāradaFn23-04] (Ven. Nārada 23-04) Matteyyatā does not mean motherhood or "to have a mother". The Commentarial explanation is good conduct (sammā-pañipatti) towards the mother, that is, ministering to the mother. The other terms are similarly explained.

.. [NāradaFn23-05] (Ven. Nārada 23-05) The Buddha, the Arahants, and so on.

.. [ThaniSFn-V324] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 324) DhpA: Dhanapalaka was a noble elephant captured for the king of Kasi. Although given palatial quarters with the finest food, he showed no interest, but thought only of the sorrow his mother felt, alone in the elephant wood, separated from her son.

.. [ThaniSFn-V329-330] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 329-330) DhpA: The bull elephant named Matanga, reflecting on the inconveniences of living in a herd crowded with she-elephants and young elephants — he was pushed around as he went into the river, had to drink muddied water, had to eat leaves that others had already nibbled, etc. — decided that he would find more pleasure in living alone. His story parallels that of the elephant in AN 9.40 and elephant the Buddha met in the Parileyyaka Forest (Mv X.4.6-7).

.. [DLMBSFn-V320] (DLMBS Commentary V320) The queen Māgandiya, the wife of the king Udena of Kosambi hated the Buddha. When he came to Kosambi, she hired some villains who followed the Buddha and abused him. Venerable Ānanda suggested that the Buddha should just leave Kosambi and go elsewhere, but the Buddha replied with this verse (and the following two, DhP 321 and Dhp 322), saying that he will endure the abuse patiently.

.. [DLMBSFn-V321] (DLMBS Commentary V321) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 320) and the following one (DhP 322). 

    A tamed elephant is very valuable: it is an important symbol of the king. The king is driven all around the city on a tamed elephant. The tamed elephant is the best of all elephants. 

    In the same way, one who "tamed" oneself is always the best of people. From the self-control begins the way to the Awakenment. Therefore, to show constraint when being abused is a very good training for those aspiring to the highest goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V322] (DLMBS Commentary V322) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses (DhP 320 and DhP 321). 

    People of all regions in all times always desired to own thoroughbred and tamed animals. In this verse we are told that someone who tamed himself is to be praised even more.

.. [DLMBSFn-V323] (DLMBS Commentary V323) A group of monks once saw an elephant trainer trying to subdue an elephant. The trainer could not succeed in any way he tried. One monk used to be an elephant trainer himself so he explained to the trainer how he should proceed. The elephant was then tamed very quickly. 

    When the monks returned to the monastery, they reported this story to the Buddha. The Buddha admonished the monk with this verse, saying that he should first tame himself. Only in this way will he be able to reach the Nirvana. Taming elephants will not help him one little bit in pursuing this goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V324] (DLMBS Commentary V324) In Sāvatthi there lived a rich Brahmin. When his wife died, he gave all his wealth to his sons. After that his sons did not care about him at all. He was left penniless and reduced to begging. He went to the Buddha and asked for advice. 

    The Buddha told him to tell his story wherever there was a large gathering of people. So the Brahmin went to the meeting of all the Brahmins from Sāvatthi (where his sons were also present) and told his story. People in the crowd got very angry and his sons were embarrassed. 

    From that time on, they took very good care of their father. The Brahmin was receiving four food-trays every day and he gave two of them to the Buddha in alms. After a time, the Buddha got invited to the house of the eldest son and there he spoke this verse: although Dhanapala was tied up in captivity, he still remembered his parents in the forest.

.. [DLMBSFn-V325] (DLMBS Commentary V325) The king Pasenadi of Kosala once went to see the Buddha just after finishing an opulent meal. As a result, he was feeling drowsy and sleepy, could not concentrate on the Buddha's words and almost fell asleep. He apologized to the Buddha and told him about his heavy meal. 

    The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that overeating creates discomfort. The king acted accordingly, ate less and became much healthier and more active.

.. [DLMBSFn-V326] (DLMBS Commentary V326) Sānu was a young *sāmanera* (novice). Once he recited the teaching and at the end he made dedication of merit to his parents. A spirit, who had been his mother in a previous existence, heard that and shared his merit. As a result, she was much respected amongst other spirits and gods. 

    But Sānu grew up and was dissatisfied with his life as a monk. He went to see his mother (in the present existence) and told her he decided to leave the Order. His mother tried to persuade him not to do so, but he was firm. The spirit also overheard this; possessed the young man's body so that he started rolling on the floor. People gathered and then spoke out about the advantages of the life of a monk. If Sānu were to disrobe, he would not reach the Awakenment. Then the spirit left. 

    After this experience Sānu decided to continue in the quest for the ultimate goal. He went back to the monastery and was fully ordained as a *bhikkhu* (monk). 
    The Buddha wanted to help him and so he spoke this verse, guiding Sānu to control his mind. Sānu reflected on the message and later attained the Arahantship. He even became a very famous and revered teacher.

.. [DLMBSFn-V327] (DLMBS Commentary V327) There was an elephant that was very strong when young, but as he got old, he became weak. Once he went to a pond and got stuck in the mud. The king sent some elephant trainers to help him. They started to beat the battle-drums. When the elephant heard them, his spirit rose and he freed himself from the mud. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he spoke this verse, saying that just as the elephant pulled himself out of mud, so we must pull ourselves from the mud of defilements and suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V328] (DLMBS Commentary V328) The monks in the city of Kosambi once quarreled about some trivial matter. This led to a terrible dispute. Even the Buddha was not able to appease the quarrelling monks. So the Buddha left them and went to the forest to stay alone. 

    After some time the monks cooled down and they realized their mistake. Therefore they went to the forest to find the Buddha and ask for his forgiveness. The Buddha told them this verse (and the following two, DhP 329 and DhP 330) to emphasize the value of a true friendship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V329] (DLMBS Commentary V329) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 328) and for the following verse (DhP 330). 

    If one does not find a good and worthy friend, it is better to be alone than to associate with bad people. Good friends are very important, because they can teach and guide us and set a good example worthy of following.

.. [DLMBSFn-V330] (DLMBS Commentary V330) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 328 and DhP 329). 

    Companionship with a fool is very stressful. We cannot change the fool's ways, because a fool is a fool and does not realize hi foolishness. We are even in danger of becoming fools ourselves, if we lose control and start to learn from the fool. Therefore it is far better to be alone and to concentrate solely on our mental development and on reaching the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V331] (DLMBS Commentary V331) The Buddha was once thinking about how so many people were ill-treated by evil rulers. He tried to think up some way to convince the kings to rule wisely. Māra then tried to entice the Buddha to become a king himself. But the Buddha replied him with this verse (and the two following ones, DhP 332 and DhP 333), saying that their teachings were quite different and it was impossible for Māra to influence him to become a king.

.. [DLMBSFn-V332] (DLMBS Commentary V332) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 331) and the following one (DhP 333). 

    Filial love towards one's parents is (or should be) one of the basic foundations of our society even now, not to speak of the Buddha's times, when it was actually a crime not to look after one's parents (see the story for the verse in DhP 324). In this verse, the Buddha says that being a monk and reaching the state of a true Brahmin (which equals attaining the Awakenment) is as important as to love one’s parents. Maybe even more important - if we are able to reach Awakenment while our parents are still alive, we can teach them and help them on their own way towards this goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V333] (DLMBS Commentary V333) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 331 and DhP 332). 

    Virtue is the first and the most important factor that we must firmly establish before we start on the way towards the Awakenment. Abstaining from evil can of course be seen as a part of a moral life, but special emphasis is being put on this, because it is the first basic part of morality. Then there is trust, confidence that the way is truly leading towards the goal, that the methods described by the Buddha really work. And then can we start cultivating our minds in meditation in order to attain wisdom and achieve the Awakenment.

.. [NāradaFn24-01] (Ven. Nārada 24-01) Craving is threefold, viz: craving for sensual pleasures (kāmataṇhā), craving connected with the notion of eternalism (bhavataṇhā), and craving connected with the notion of nihilism (vibhavataṇhā).

                    Craving for personal sense-fields, such as eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind, and for external sense-fields, such as form, sound, scent, taste, contact, and dhammas (mental objects), when viewed in the foregoing three aspects, divides itself into thirty-six varieties. When they are viewed according to past, present, and future they become one hundred and eight.

                    Bhavataṇhā may also be interpreted as attachment to life or Realms of Form, and vibhavataṇhā as attachment to annihilation or Formless Realms.

.. [NāradaFn24-02] (Ven. Nārada 24-02) Passions.

.. [NāradaFn24-03] (Ven. Nārada 24-03) See note on v. 334.

.. [NāradaFn24-04] (Ven. Nārada 24-04) Through the six sense-doors.

.. [NāradaFn24-05] (Ven. Nārada 24-05) That is, from the six sense-doors.

.. [NāradaFn24-06] (Ven. Nārada 24-06) Resting on the six sense-objects.

.. [NāradaFn24-07] (Ven. Nārada 24-07) There are five kinds of bonds (saṅga) - namely: lust, hatred, delusion, pride, and false views.

.. [NāradaFn24-08] (Ven. Nārada 24-08) Here is a pun on the two meanings of vana, forest and desire.

.. [NāradaFn24-09] (Ven. Nārada 24-09) Editor's note: The text here actually reads vajanti dhīrā, as in the following verse; but Ven Nārada translates: 'leave the world' which can only refer to paribbajanti as in other editions.

.. [NāradaFn24-10] (Ven. Nārada 24-10) That is, attachment to the past, present, and future Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn24-11] (Ven. Nārada 24-11) This is the meditation on the impurities of the body by practising which one can get rid of attachment to the body.

.. [NāradaFn24-12] (Ven. Nārada 24-12) Niruttipadakovido - versed in the four kinds of analytical knowledge (pañisambhidā) - namely: meaning (attha), text (dhamma), etymology (nirutti), and understanding (pañibhāna).

.. [NāradaFn24-13] (Ven. Nārada 24-13) Arahantship.

.. [BudRkFn-v339] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 339) The thirty-six currents of craving: the three cravings — for sensual pleasure, for continued existence, and for annihilation — in relation to each of the twelve bases — the six sense organs, including mind, and their corresponding objects.

.. [BudRkFn-v344] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 344) This verse, in the original, puns with the Pali word vana meaning both "desire" and "forest."

.. [BudRkFn-v353] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 353) This was the Buddha's reply to a wandering ascetic who asked him about his teacher. The Buddha's answer shows that Supreme Enlightenment was his own unique attainment, which he had not learned from anyone else.

.. [ThaniSFn-V337] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 337) This verse provides a Buddhist twist to the typical benedictions found in works of kavya. Instead of expressing a wish that the listeners meet with wealth, fame, status, or other worldly forms of good fortune, it describes the highest good fortune, which can be accomplished only through one's own skillful kamma: the uprooting of craving and the resulting state of total freedom from the round of death and rebirth. A similar twist on the theme of good fortune is found in the Mangala Sutta (Khp.5, Sn 2.4), which teaches that the best protective charm is to develop skillful kamma, ultimately developing the mind to the point where it is untouched by the vagaries of the world.

.. [ThaniSFn-V339] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 339) 36 streams = three forms of desire for each of the internal and external sense spheres (see note 294) — 3 x 2 x 6 = 36. According to one sub-commentary, the three forms of desire are desires focused on the present, past, and future. According to another, they are craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, and craving for no-becoming.

.. [ThaniSFn-V340] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 340) "Every which way": Reading sabbadhi with the Thai and Burmese editions. The creeper, according to DhpA, is craving, which sends thoughts out to wrap around its objects, while it itself stays rooted in the mind.

.. [ThaniSFn-V341] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 341) This verse contains an implied simile: the terms "loosened & oiled," here applied to joys, were commonly used to describe smooth bowel movements.

.. [ThaniSFn-V343] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 343) For the various meanings that attano — "for himself" — can have in this verse, see note 402.

.. [ThaniSFn-V346] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 346) "Elastic": The usual translation for sithilam — "slack" — does not fit in this verse, but all the Pali recensions are unanimous on this reading, so I have chosen a near synonym that does. The Patna Dhp renders this term as "subtle," whereas the Tibetan commentary to the Udanavarga explains the line as a whole as meaning "hard for the slack to untie." Both alternatives make sense, but may be attempts to "correct" a term that could well have originally meant "elastic," a meaning that got lost with the passage of time.

.. [ThaniSFn-V348] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 348) DhpA: In front = the aggregates of the past; behind = the aggregates of the future; in between = the aggregates of the present. See also note 385.

.. [ThaniSFn-V350] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 350) "A focus on the foul": A meditative exercise in focusing on the foul parts of the body so as to help undercut lust and attachment for the body. See note 7-8.

.. [ThaniSFn-V352] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 352) "Astute in expression, knowing the combination of sounds — which comes first & which after": Some arahants, in addition to their ability to overcome all of their defilements, are also endowed with four forms of acumen (patisambhida), one of which is acumen with regard to expression (nirutti-patisambhida), i.e., a total mastery of linguistic expression. This talent in particular must have been of interest to the anthologist(s) who put together the Dhp.

                     "Last-body": Because an arahant will not be reborn, this present body is his/her last.

.. [ThaniSFn-V353] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 353) According to MN 26 and Mv I.6.7, one of the first people the Buddha met after his Awakening was an ascetic who commented on the clarity of his faculties and asked who his teacher was. This verse was part of the Buddha's response.

.. [ThaniSFn-V354] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 354) This verse contains several terms related to aesthetics. Both dhamma (justice) and dana (gift/generosity) are sub-types of the heroic rasa, or savor. (See the Introduction.) The third sub-type of the heroic — yuddha (warfare) — is suggested by the verb "conquer," which occurs four times in the Pali. Rati (delight/love) is the emotion (bhava) that corresponds to the sensitive rasa. In effect, the verse is saying that the highest forms of rasa and emotion are those related to Dhamma; the highest expression of the heroic Dhamma rasa is in the ending of craving.

.. [VaradoFn-V340] (Ven. Varado V.340) Verse 340: "A river courses far and wide/ The creeping vine, where it sprouts it abides". I take this to mean that although sensation (vedana) courses far and wide, free of attachment, like a river, clinging is static, like a vine.  

.. [VaradoFn-V341] (Ven. Varado V.341) Verse 341: My translation of the first line has been largely guided by the context of the second line. 

.. [VaradoFn-V344] (Ven. Varado V.344) Verse 344: "wood/would" reflects the Pali "vana/vana" word-play. 

.. [VaradoFn-V346] (Ven. Varado V.346) Verse 346: "easy to don" (ohārinaṃ sithilaṃ). Comments in PED suggest this can be translated as "yielding to take down". 

.. [VaradoFn-V352] (Ven. Varado V.352) Verse 352:   
                    Adept at linguistics (niruttipadakovido) which PED says means "skilled in the dialect or the original language of the holy Scriptures".   
                  
                    Proficient in words and semantics (sannipātaṃ) which PED says means "collocation" i.e. the characteristic combination of words in a language.

                    Skilled in phonetics (akkhara) which PED says means "phonetics which probably included grammar".  
                  
                    Expert in syntax (pubbāparā) which PED says means what precedes and what follows, what comes first and what last, with reference to the successive order of syllables and words in the text of the Scriptures".

.. [DLMBSFn-V334] (DLMBS Commentary V334) A fisherman in Sāvatthi once caught a beautiful golden fish. But when the fish opened its mouth, horrible smell spread all around. The Buddha was asked why this was so. 

    The fish had been a monk named Kapila long time ago. Kapila was very learned and famous. He taught the Dharma to many people. As a result of this he became very conceited and looked down on other monks. Whenever somebody would try to censure him, Kapila would just grow angry. Soon everybody avoided him and that made Kapila even angrier and he developed hatred for the monks and for the Dharma. 

    As a result of his conceit and hatred, he had to suffer for a long time. Because he taught the Dharma to many, he had a beautiful golden body. But because he used his mouth to abuse the monks and the Dharma, his breath was stinky and foul. The Buddha then added this verse (and the three following ones, DhP 335, DhP 336 and DhP 337).

.. [DLMBSFn-V335] (DLMBS Commentary V335) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 334) and the two following verses (DhP 336 and DhP 337). 

    Thirst and craving are one of the main roots of evil, origins of suffering. The more we are in power of craving, the more suffering and sorrow will befall us. To cut off the craving in our minds is to destroy all sorrow and suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V336] (DLMBS Commentary V336) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 334 and DhP 335) and for the following verse (DhP 337). 

    To defeat the thirst and craving is to defeat the suffering and sorrow. It equals the attainment of Awakenment. Only after reaching the goal of Arahantship, is the thirst completely eradicated and the mind is free from sorrow and suffering. In order to do that one must practice meditation diligently, as taught by the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V337] (DLMBS Commentary V337) The fishermen in Sāvatthi once caught a beautiful golden fish. They took it to the king who in turn sent it to the Buddha. When the fish opened its mouth, horrible smell spread all around. 

    When asked about this, the Buddha replied that this fish as a learned monk named Kapila a long time ago, during the times of the Buddha Kassapa. Kapila was learned, but very conceited. He did not stand any criticism from other monks, whom he looked down upon. As a result, the other monks started to avoid him. At one occasion, Kapila was delivering a discourse, but nobody went to attend. Kapila then started to think that Dharma had no meaning at all. Because of this, he was born as a fish with a foul breath. But because he taught the Dharma to many before he became so sour, he had a beautiful golden body. 

    The Buddha then spoke this verse and went on to stress the importance of equally combining theoretical learning with meditation practice.

.. [DLMBSFn-V338] (DLMBS Commentary V338) Once the Buddha saw a female pig and he smiled. Venerable Ānanda asked him about the reason for his smile. The Buddha told him that this pig used to be a hen during the times pf the previous Buddha. The hen lived close to a monastery and as a result listened to the discourses. Later she was reborn as a princess. Once she noticed some worms in the toilet and started to meditate on the repulsiveness of the body. Later she was reborn as a Brahma type of deity. And now again, because of some demerit, she was born as a pig. The Buddha commented in this verse (and the five following ones, DhP 339 - DhP 343) how there was simply no end of the round of existences on account of good and bad karma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V339] (DLMBS Commentary V339) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 338) and for the four following verses (DhP 340 - DhP 343). 

    The thirty-six streams in this verse are the three types of craving (for sensual pleasure, for eternal existence, for non-existence) in relation to each of six sense organs that the Buddhist psychology works with: eye, nose, ears, tongue, body and mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V340] (DLMBS Commentary V340) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous verses (DhP 338 and DhP 339) and with the three following verses (DhP 341, DhP 342 and DhP 343). 

    The streams in this verse are identical with the thirty-six streams from the previous verse (DhP 339). The creeper means passion. It has to be cut off completely with the wisdom gained in meditation practice in order to enable us to reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V341] (DLMBS Commentary V341) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the three previous verses (DhP 338, Dhp 339 and Dhp 340) and for the two following verses (DhP 342 and DhP 343). 

    Our senses bring in all kinds of data. We are attached to the pleasures coming from these senses. Because of that, we create positive and negative karma and this karma will come into fruition in the future as more births and deaths for us. The solution is to cut off the attachment to this pleasure and with equanimity concentrate on the highest goal, the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V342] (DLMBS Commentary V342) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the four previous verses (DhP 338, DhP 339, DhP 340 and DhP 341) and for the following verse (DhP 343). 

    There are ten fetters (**saṃyojana**). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. 
  
    The five big fetters are:

    1) personality belief (**sakkāya-diṭṭhi**), 
    2) skeptical doubt (**vicikicchā**), 
    3) clinging to rules and rituals (**sīlabbata-paramāsa**), 
    4) sensuous craving (**kāma-rāga**), 
    5) ill-will (**vyāpāda**).

    The five small fetters are:
     
    1) craving for fine-material existence (**rūpa-rāga**), 
    2) craving for immaterial existence (**arūpa-rāga**), 
    3) conceit (**māna**), 
    4) restlessness (**uddhacca**), 
    5) ignorance (**avijjā**). 

.. [DLMBSFn-V343] (DLMBS Commentary V343) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the five previous verses (DhP 338, DhP 339, DhP 340, DhP 341 and DhP 342). 
    Because of craving people "crawl around" from existence into existence. Just like a captured hare tries very hard to escape but the fetter is stronger, so it manages only to cut itself. People also try to be free but do it the wrong way, only falling more and more deeply into the snare of passions and repeated existence. The solution is to remove all the passion and thirst and escape the snare of *Samsara* forever.

.. [DLMBSFn-V344] (DLMBS Commentary V344) A certain monk was a pupil of Venerable Mahā Kassapa. Although he did not reach any stage of Awakenment, he was able to achieve the four mental absorptions (**jhāna**). Once he visited his uncle who was a goldsmith and developed a strong craving for the gold ornaments he saw there. Therefore he left the Order and came to live with his uncle. 

    But because he was lazy, his uncle threw him out of the house. The man became a thief. After some time he was caught and sentenced to execution. At the execution ground he did not show any fear at all and established himself in deep mental absorption. When the executioners saw that they were very surprised and informed the king. The king gave the order to release the man. 

    The Buddha then admonished the monk with this verse, showing him how foolish it was to leave the monk's life. He further instructed the man in the meditation of insight. The man reached the first stage of Awakenment. Later he rejoined the Order and soon reached the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V345] (DLMBS Commentary V345) A group of monks once went to the city of Sāvatthi for almsfood. On their way they observed some prisoners being led with their hands and legs chained in bonds. When they returned to the monastery they related the matter to the Buddha. 

    The Buddha spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 346) and explained that passion and craving were much stronger fetters than all the chains and handcuffs.

.. [DLMBSFn-V346] (DLMBS Commentary V346) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 345). 

    All the man-made fetters like iron handcuffs, ropes and wooden bonds can not equal craving and longing for beautiful things and loved persons. Bond by these fetters, all beings crawl from existence to existence, unable to break free. Only through abandoning this craving can we be free from the fetters of *Samsara*. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V347] (DLMBS Commentary V347) Queen Khemā was the wife of king Bimbisāra. She was very beautiful and proud of her beauty. The king wanted her to go to the monastery and listen to the Buddha's discourse. But Khemā knew that the Buddha often talked about impermanency and non-attachment to the body, she did not dare to go to see him. 

    Finally the king ordered his musicians to play a song praising the Veluvana monastery and the queen decided to go. She sat in the audience while the Buddha was expounding the teaching. The Buddha then created a vision of a female form (which was visible only to Khemā) to sit near him on the stage, where he was delivering his speech and to fan him. The girl was very young and extremely beautiful. Khemā saw her and realized that compared to this girl she herself looked like a monkey. 

    While she was looking, the girl began to grow older. She became a young woman, then a grown up woman, middle aged, old - and finally she became a very old woman. Khemā realized that the change of the body is a continuing process and she found out that this beautiful young girl changed into an old ugly woman. Then the woman on stage, no longer able to control her body, was lying there, dying and finally she died. Her body got swollen and worms were all over it. 

    Khemā thus finally realized that also her beauty was very impermanent - it was subjected to illness, old age and death. The Buddha further instructed her with this verse and at the end Khemā attained Arahantship. Later she joined the order and became the chief female disciple of the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V348] (DLMBS Commentary V348) Once a group of wandering acrobats came to Rājagaha. A young man named Uggasena fell in love with a beautiful dancer from the troupe. He married her and joined the group. But since he was not an acrobat, he could only help carry boxes, drive carts and perform similar tasks. 

    The girl gave birth to a son later but she often scolded her husband for not being able to do anything better. Uggasena therefore learned the secrets of acrobatics and became a very skilful acrobat himself. 

    One day the group returned to Rājagaha. Uggasena was eager to perform as he expected to be applauded for his skills. Just as he was performing, the Buddha passed near the place and all the attention of the crowd was drawn to him. Uggasena just sat there feeling very depressed. The Buddha told him this verse and Uggasena reached the Awakenment there and then. He became a monk immediately. 

    Later the Buddha told Uggasena's story. A long time ago, during the times of the Buddha Kassapa, Uggasena gave almsfood to a monk and made a wish that he could reach Arahantship one day. The monk was an Arahant and looked into the future and smiled, because he was able to see that his wish would be fulfilled. Uggasena misunderstood the monk's smile and thought the monk was laughing at him. Therefore he became angry. Because of that he had to travel with a group of acrobats for some time before reaching his goal.

.. [DLMBSFn-V349] (DLMBS Commentary V349) A young monk once asked for some water in a house where a young woman lived alone. She fell in love with him immediately and invited him to come over for almsfood anytime he wanted. Later she would hint that she had enough money but felt very lonely. The monk felt himself attracted to her and began contemplating leaving the Order and marrying her. He became thin and nervous because of his thoughts and the matter was reported to the Buddha. 

    The Buddha told the monk that in his previous life this woman was his wife. Once they were traveling and met some thieves. She fell in love with their leader and helped him kill her husband. Just like in the previous life she was the source of his death, so in this life she could well be the ruin of his life as a monk. The Buddha then spoke this verse (and the following one, DhP 350). 
    The monk took the advice to his heart and began striving diligently towards the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V350] (DLMBS Commentary V350) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 349). 

    The more we think about the pleasant things, the more we desire them. The thirst and attachment will grow. We should also reflect on the unpleasant and impure things in order to restrain our thirst and craving. In this way, we will be able to cut off the fetters that bind us to this world and we can reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V351] (DLMBS Commentary V351) A large group of monks came to visit the Jetavana monastery. The Buddha's son, novice Rāhula had to sleep outside. Mara then took the form of an elephant and tried to scare Rāhula. But Rāhula did not show any trace of fear. The Buddha then came out and told Mara this verse (and the following one, DhP 352) telling him that Rāhula was an Arahant and could not be scared by anything in the world. Mara realized he lost and disappeared.

.. [DLMBSFn-V352] (DLMBS Commentary V352) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 351). 

    At the time of the Buddha, the sacred texts of various religions were not supposed to be written down. It was considered a kind of sacrilege to do that. Writing was reserved only for worldly matters. Therefore it was crucial that the texts were always remembered correctly and without alteration, in order to protect the true words of the teacher without his disciples changing the meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V353] (DLMBS Commentary V353) Just a short time after the Buddha had reached the Awakenment, he met a wandering ascetic named Upaka. Upaka was very impressed by the Buddha and asked him, who was his teacher. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying he did not have any teacher, but that he reached the Awakenment completely on his own. At the end Upaka said he did neither believed the Buddha nor disbelieved him and just walked away.

.. [DLMBSFn-V354] (DLMBS Commentary V354) The gods were once arguing about four questions: Which is the best of all gifts? Which is the best among tastes? Which is the best of joys? How to conquer all suffering? They could not agree on an answer, so Sakka, the king of gods, went to see the Buddha and asked him these questions. The Buddha replied with this verse. 

    Sakka then requested that he gods be invited to share the merit accumulated by the gift of Dharma. The Buddha agreed and from that time on it is a custom to invite the gods to partake of the merit whenever a good deed is done.

.. [DLMBSFn-V355] (DLMBS Commentary V355) King of Kosala came to see the Buddha once and told him that a rich old man died that day in Sāvatthi. He did not leave any heirs and so all his wealth was taken to the state treasury. He also related that the man was very stingy and did not give anything in charity. 

    The Buddha then revealed that this man was also very rich in one of his past existences. Once he offered some almsfood to a monk but then in his stinginess regretted his deed. His brother who was also very rich had a son and this man killed the young boy in order to inherit all his brother's wealth. Because of that these deeds he suffered for a long time. In this present existence he did nothing to accumulate merit and therefore missed a good opportunity to do good with his wealth.

.. [DLMBSFn-V356] (DLMBS Commentary V356) When the Buddha's mother died, she became a goddess named Santusitā in the Tāvatimsa heaven. When the Buddha attained the Awakenment, he went there to teach her the Dharma. While he was there, he also met two other gods. One of them, Indaka, was a man in his previous existence, who once offered a little almsfood to Venerable Anuruddha, the Buddha's disciple. The other god, Ankura, had given much almsfood in his lifetime as a human being, but none of the almsfood was to truly Awakened people. Ankura asked the Buddha how was it possible, that he had given so much and still was reborn in the same heaven as Indaka, who gave almsfood only once. The Buddha then replied with this verse (and three following ones, DhP 357, DhP 358 and DhP 359), saying that quality is more important than quantity.

.. [DLMBSFn-V357] (DLMBS Commentary V357) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 356) and the two following verses (DhP 358, DhP 359). 

    Giving alms is very important, but we must also differentiate to whom we give. The gifts to those who are free of attachments bring much more fruit than what we give to someone who is enslaved by passion, hatred and ignorance.

.. [DLMBSFn-V358] (DLMBS Commentary V358) The story for this verse is identical with the one for two previous verses (DhP 356 and DhP 357) and for the following verse (DhP 359).

.. [DLMBSFn-V359] (DLMBS Commentary V359) The story for this verse is identical with the one for three previous verses (DhP 356, DhP 357 and DhP 358). 

    By these four verses the Buddha stresses the importance of giving alms to those who really deserve it. To give alms to those who are just lazy to work for their living will do harm to the society as well as to those people in question.

.. [NāradaFn25-10] (Ven. Nārada 25-10) They are the five fetters that pertain to the Farther Shore (uddhambhāgiyasaṃyojana), namely: attachment to the Realms of Form (rūparāga), attachment to the Formless Realms (arūparāga), conceit (māna), restlessness (uddhacca), and ignorance (avijjā).

.. [NāradaFn25-11] (Ven. Nārada 25-11) Namely: confidence (saddhā), mindfulness (sati), effort (viriya), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (pa¤¤ā). These five factors have to be cultivated if one desires to destroy the fetters.

.. [BudRkFn-v370] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 370) The five to be cut off are the five "lower fetters": self-illusion, doubt, belief in rites and rituals, lust and ill-will. The five to be abandoned are the five "higher fetters": craving for the divine realms with form, craving for the formless realms, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Stream-enterers and once-returners cut off the first three fetters, non-returners the next two and Arahants the last five. The five to be cultivated are the five spiritual faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The five bonds are: greed, hatred, delusion, false views, and conceit.

.. [ThaniSFn-V363] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 363) "Counsel": In the context of Indian literary theory, this is the meaning of the word manta, which can also mean "chant." The literary context seems to be the proper one here.

.. [ThaniSFn-V368] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 368) "Stilling-of-fabrications ease": the true ease and freedom experienced when all five aggregates are stilled.

.. [ThaniSFn-V369] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 369) DhpA: The boat = one's own personhood (atta-bhava, the body-mind complex); the water that needs to be bailed out = wrong thoughts (imbued with passion, aversion, or delusion).

.. [ThaniSFn-V370] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 370) DhpA: Cut through five = the five lower fetters that tie the mind to the round of rebirth (self-identity views, uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices, sensual passion, irritation); let go of five = the five higher fetters (passion for form, passion for formless phenomena, conceit, restlessness, ignorance); develop five = the five faculties (conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, discernment); five attachments = passion, aversion, delusion, conceit, views.

.. [ThaniSFn-V381] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 381) See note 368.

.. [DLMBSFn-V360] (DLMBS Commentary V360) In Sāvatthi there were five monks who practiced restraint over just one of the senses. All of them claimed that they alone practiced the most important and difficult type of restraint. They quarreled for a long time and could not agree. Finally they went to ask the Buddha, who answered them with this verse (and the following one, DhP 361), saying that one must control all senses in order to reach the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V361] (DLMBS Commentary V361) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 360). 

    Restraint over the six senses (in Buddhist psychology, the mind is counted as the sixths sense) is one of the basic requirements for really beneficial meditation practice. Without this control, the meditation cannot progress, because we will always be distracted from it by input from these very six senses. Therefore we must practice concentration and mindfulness in our daily lives and then apply this tool in our meditation practice.

.. [DLMBSFn-V362] (DLMBS Commentary V362) There was a monk who was very skilled in throwing stones. Once he was sitting with his friends and they observed some geese flying over them. The monk boasted he could hit the eye of one of the geese. He took a pebble and threw it. The pebble hit the bird in the eye and the goose fell down dead. 

    Other monks reported the incident to the Buddha who admonished the monk with this verse, telling him not to hurt any living beings and to strive for the Awakenment by the way of practicing restraint.

.. [DLMBSFn-V363] (DLMBS Commentary V363) Venerable Sāriputta and Venerable Moggallāna were abused by a monk named Kokālika. As a result, suffering befell Kokālika. The other monks then remarked that he had to suffer because he could not control his tongue. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that control over one's mouth is very important.

.. [DLMBSFn-V364] (DLMBS Commentary V364) Close to the age of eighty years, the Buddha announced that he would attain the Parinibbāna (pass away) very soon. The monks who had not attained the Awakenment yet, were very distressed and spent all the time with the Buddha, never leaving his presence. But there was a monk named Dhammārāma who did not come to see the Buddha but kept to himself. Other monks thought he was disrespectful towards the teacher. But Dhammārāma explained that in his opinion the highest homage to the Buddha would be if he could attain the Awakenment before the Buddha's passing away. 

    The Buddha praised Dhammārāma by this verse saying that a monk who really wants to pay homage to him should act as Dhammārāma did.

.. [DLMBSFn-V365] (DLMBS Commentary V365) Devadatta was the Buddha's cousin, He envied the Buddha his position and even though he himself was not an Arahant he tried to form his own separate school in opposition to the Buddha. 

    Once a certain monk of the Buddha went to the Devadatta's monastery and appeared to be very friendly with the monks who lived there. He went there often, eating and enjoying that comfortable monastery. But still he claimed he did not become a follower of Devadatta. When the Buddha heard about this, he summoned the monk and told him this verse (and the following one, DhP 366) saying that he should not envy Devadatta's followers their comfort but should rather concentrate on his own meditation practice.

.. [DLMBSFn-V366] (DLMBS Commentary V366) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 365). 

    For a monk, material gains and comforts should not be important. A monk should disregard all the material gains and concentrate solely on spiritual gains. Material comfort can actually be a hindrance on the monk's path towards the Awakenment. Of course, this does not apply only to monks. All the Buddha's followers should view material wealth as not really important and spiritual wealth as the only really valuable thing.

.. [DLMBSFn-V367] (DLMBS Commentary V367) In Sāvatthi lived a Brahmin and his wife who were followers of the Buddha. Often they offered almsfood to him and the monks. 

    One day the Buddha came to their house to ask for some almsfood. The Brahmin was already eating and his wife was afraid that if her husband saw the Buddha he would offer all their food to him and she would have to cook again. So she went out and told the Buddha they had not food left that day. The Buddha knew they were both close to attaining the third stage of Awakenment, so he just shook his head and kept standing there. The wife could not help herself and started laughing. 

    Her husband came out and immediately offered all their food to the Buddha. Then he asked how a monk should be judged, what makes a true monk. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a true monk is not attached to anything in his body or his mind. Hearing this, the Brahmin and his wife attained the third stage of Awakenment (called **anāgāmi**).

.. [DLMBSFn-V368] (DLMBS Commentary V368) There was a rich lady living in a certain village. She had a son named Sona, who became a monk. Once he passed through his hometown on his way back to the Jetavana monastery. When his mother heard this, she organized a grand charity in his honor. She also erected a pavilion so that Sona could teach her and other villagers the Dharma. 

    While they were at the pavilion listening to Sona's discourse, some thieves broke into the lady's house. Their leader went to the pavilion to make sure she did not return home earlier. The maid who was left behind came quickly telling her about the thieves. But the lady just said, "Let them take everything, I will not be disturbed while listening to the Dharma". The leader of the thieves got scared, returned to the house and told his companions to return all the stolen goods. Then they all went to the pavilion and listened to the Dharma. 

    When the discourse was finished, they begged the lady for forgiveness. She forgave them and all the thieves became monks. They went to the forest and practiced meditation diligently. The Buddha told them this verse (and the eight following ones) to help them on their way to the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V369] (DLMBS Commentary V369) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 368) and for the seven following verses (DhP 370 - DhP 376). 
    Our striving for the peace of mind, the Nirvana, is often compared with crossing a river. If our boat (our mind) is filled with water (passion and hatred) it is extremely hard or almost impossible to cross to the other shore. We have to empty the boat of our mind of water (consisting mainly but not only of passion and hatred) to be able to make it to the other shore of Nirvana quickly and safely.

.. [DLMBSFn-V370] (DLMBS Commentary V370) The story for this verse is identical with the one for two previous verses (DhP 368, DhP 369) and for the following six verses (DhP 371 - DhP 376).

    The five things to be cut off are the five "big" fetters: 

    1) personality belief (**sakkāya-diṭṭhi**), 
    2) skeptical doubt (**vicikicchā**), 
    3) clinging to rules and rituals (**sīlabbata-paramāsa**), 
    4) sensuous craving (**kāma-rāga**), 
    5) ill-will (**vyāpāda**).

    The five things to be abandoned are the five "small" fetters: 

    1) craving for fine-material existence (**rūpa-rāga**), 
    2) craving for immaterial existence (**arūpa-rāga**), 
    3) conceit (**māna**), 
    4) restlessness (**uddhacca**), 
    5) ignorance (**avijjā**). 

    The five things to be cultivated are: 

    1) confidence (**saddhā**), 
    2) mindfulness (**sati**), 
    3) effort (**viriya**), 
    4) concentration (**samādhi**), 
    5) wisdom (**paññā**).

    The five attachments are: 

    1) passion (**rāga**), 
    2) hatred (**dosa**), 
    3) ignorance (**moha**), 
    4) pride (**māna**), 
    5) false views (**diṭṭhi**). 

.. [DLMBSFn-V371] (DLMBS Commentary V371) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the three previous verses (DhP 368 - DhP 370) and for the following five verses (DhP 372 - DhP 376). 

    The five strands of sensual pleasures are all the pleasures, which can be enjoyed by any of the five senses. These pleasures are what most of the people strive for in this world and also in the next existence. For a follower of the Buddha they are obstacles on his path to the Awakenment and they are to be eradicated if we want to achieve any progress at all. 

    The metal ball and burning refers to suffering that will surely follow the enjoyment of the sensual pleasures. Then it will be late to cry. Therefore we should diligently meditate and restrain our mind, so that it will not seek for the pleasures.

.. [DLMBSFn-V372] (DLMBS Commentary V372) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the four previous verses (DhP 368 - DhP 371) and for the following four verses (DhP 373 - DhP376). 

    Wisdom comes as a product of long and diligent meditation. There is no other way to obtain wisdom. On the other hand, one must possess an initial small portion of wisdom in order to understand the necessity of meditation. As a result, most people never start to meditate or if they do, they tire quickly and give up. 
    Only one, who is wise and uses the wisdom in meditation in order to achieve even more wisdom, is able to reach the goal of Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V373] (DLMBS Commentary V373) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the five previous verses (DhP 368 - DhP 372) and for the following three verses (DhP 374 - DhP 376). 

    Staying in solitude is beneficial for monks who are practicing meditation so that they are cut off from all outside distractions. If a monk diligently meditates in solitude, his mind becomes tranquil and peaceful. Then he can gain a deep insight into the Dharma and realize the true nature of things. As a result, he experiences joy that is not felt by most people who are worldly oriented and their mind are in a whirlwind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V374] (DLMBS Commentary V374) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the six previous verses (DhP 368 – DhP 373) and for the following two verses (DhP 375 and DhP 376). 

    The five aggregates (**khandha**) are: **rūpa** (form, body, matter), **vedanā** (feeling), **saññā** (perception), **saṅkhāra** (mental formations) and **viññāna** (consciousness). If we know truly and into last detail how these five aggregates come into being and how they disappear, we experience joy and happiness and know "the deathlessness" - in other words, the Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V375] (DLMBS Commentary V375) The story for this verse is identical with the one for seven previous verses (DhP 368 - DhP 374) and also for the following verse (DhP 376). 

    As a tree needs its roots in order to be able to grow higher, so the life of a monk needs some basic roots in order to be able to reach the Nirvana. They are: guarding of one's own senses (mind being the sixth sense), contentment with what one has and observing the 227 precepts of a monk, as given by the Buddha. If we nourish these roots diligently and for a long time, the tree of wisdom will grow higher and higher, fruiting in the attainment of Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V376] (DLMBS Commentary V376) The story for this verse is identical with the one for eight previous verses (DhP 368 - DhP 375). 

    Friends are very important for a monk as well as for all other people. Good friends can set up a good example and can help on our way to the Awakenment. And of course, we can help them. Bad friends will only drag us down, towards bad habits and negligence.

.. [DLMBSFn-V377] (DLMBS Commentary V377) A group of monks received a subject of meditation from the Buddha and they started to practice diligently. Once they observed a jasmine flowers, which blossomed beautifully in the morning, only to wither away and be shed in the evening. They realized that they must do the same with all the mental defilements of their minds. The Buddha then spoke this verse to them, further reinforcing the idea. The monks reflected on this and soon all attained the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V378] (DLMBS Commentary V378) A certain monk name Santakāya used to be a lion in his previous existence. He was very calm, moved only a little, he was very composed. Other monks reported this to the Buddha who told them about Santakāya's former existence and then further spoke this verse, saying that every monk should behave in this way - be calm and composed, like a lion.

.. [DLMBSFn-V379] (DLMBS Commentary V379) There was a poor farmer named Nangala Kula. Once he was ploughing a field wearing his old clothes, when he saw a monk passing by. He asked to be ordained and became a monk on the spot. He left his plough and old clothes there and went to the monastery, which was not very far. 

    After a time he would grow discontented with a life of a monk. In that case, he would go back to the tree, where he left his plough and clothes and would remind himself of his poor past. Thus his discontent left and he went back to his meditation practice. This happened several times. 

    Other monks observed his visits to the tree and asked him what it meant. He replied that he had to go to his teacher. After some time he attained the Arahantship and stopped going to the tree. The monks asked him why he stopped. He told them that he did not need a teacher any longer. The monks asked the Buddha if that was so and the Buddha confirmed that Nangala Kula has indeed attained the Arahantship. The Buddha then added this verse (and the following one, DhP 380).

.. [DLMBSFn-V380] (DLMBS Commentary V380) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 379). 

    We are makers of our own destiny and we should not wait for any higher power to interfere in our lives and bring us happiness. By our actions, words and thoughts we every moment create our future. Therefore we must control our minds and tame it, just like if it was a horse. Only then our mind will "behave" and we will attain happiness.

.. [DLMBSFn-V381] (DLMBS Commentary V381) In Sāvatthi there lived a young man named Vakkali. When he saw the Buddha for the first time he was very impressed with his calm and radiant appearance. He became a monk just to be close to the Buddha. As a result, he neglected his own spiritual development. The Buddha exhorted him that in order to see the Buddha, one must see the Dharma, his teaching. And he sent Vakkali away. Vakkali was very depressed and contemplated suicide. The Buddha understood his mind and sent forth his radiance to Vakkali’s presence. Vakkali felt as if the Buddha was really there, his mind calmed and he started to practice diligently. Soon he reached the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V382] (DLMBS Commentary V382) Venerable Anuruddha had a young pupil, a novice named Sumana. Although he was very young, he not only attained the Arahantship, but he was also endowed with supernatural powers. Once he brought a jar of water for his teacher from Anotatta Lake, which was extremely far away, by using his powers and flying to the lake. 

    Once Anuruddha took Sumana to see the Buddha. Other novices laughed at Sumana because of his young age. So the Buddha announced that he wanted some novice to bring him water from Anotatta Lake. None of the novices was able to do so, except for Sumana, who flew to the lake as before. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that age does not matter if one practices the Dharma diligently.

.. [BudRkFn-v383] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 383) "Holy man" is used as a makeshift rendering for brahmana, intended to reproduce the ambiguity of the Indian word. Originally men of spiritual stature, by the time of the Buddha the brahmans had turned into a privileged priesthood which defined itself by means of birth and lineage rather than by genuine inner sanctity. The Buddha attempted to restore to the word brahmana its original connotation by identifying the true "holy man" as the arahant, who merits the title through his own inward purity and holiness regardless of family lineage. The contrast between the two meanings is highlighted in verses 393 and 396. Those who led a contemplative life dedicated to gaining Arahantship could also be called brahmans, as in verses 383, 389, and 390.

.. [BudRkFn-v385] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 385) This shore: the six sense organs; the other shore: their corresponding objects; both: I-ness and my-ness.

.. [BudRkFn-v394] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 394) In the time of the Buddha, such ascetic practices as wearing matted hair and garments of hides were considered marks of holiness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V383] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 383) This verse, addressed to a member of the brahman caste, is one of the few in Dhp where the word brahman is used in its ordinary sense, as indicating caste membership, and not in its special Buddhist sense as indicating an arahant.

.. [ThaniSFn-V384] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 384) DhpA: two things = tranquility meditation and insight meditation.

.. [ThaniSFn-V385] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 385) DhpA: This verse refers to a person who has no sense of "I" or "mine," either for the senses ("not-beyond") or their objects ("beyond"). The passage may also refer to the sense of total limitlessness that makes the experience of Unbinding totally ineffable, as reflected in the following conversation (Sn 5.6):
                    ::

                     Upasiva:
                     He who has reached the end:
                      Does he not exist,
                      or is he for eternity free from dis-ease?
                     Please, sage, declare this to me
                      as this phenomenon has been known by you.

                     The Buddha:
                     One who has reached the end has no criterion
                     by which anyone would say that —
                         it doesn't exist for him.
                     When all phenomena are done away with,
                     all means of speaking are done away with as well.

.. [ThaniSFn-V388] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 388) Stains = the impurities listed in note 236. On "consonance," see note 265.

.. [ThaniSFn-V389] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 389) The word "anger" here is added from DhpA, which interprets the "letting loose" as the act of retaliating with anger against one's assailant. Some translators read "brahman" as the subject not only of the second line, but also the first: "A brahman should/would not strike a brahman." However, this reading is unlikely, for a brahman (in this context, an arahant) would not strike anyone at all. If a brahman retaliates with anger to being struck, that is a sign that he is not a true brahman: thus more shame on him for having assumed a status not truly his. On the topic of how to react to violent attack, see MN 21 and MN 145.

.. [ThaniSFn-V390] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 390) "What's endearing & not": In the phrase manaso piyehi, piyehi can be read straight as it is, as "endearing," or as an elided form of apiyehi, "not endearing." The former reading is more straightforward, but given the reference to "harmful-heartedness" in the next line, the latter reading serves to tie the stanza together. It is also consistent with the fact that DhpA takes this verse to be a continuation of 389. Given the way in which kavya cultivated a taste for ambiguities and multiple interpretations, both readings may have been intended.

.. [ThaniSFn-V392] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 392) "Brahman" here is used in its ordinary sense, as indicating caste membership, and not in its special Buddhist sense as indicating an arahant.

.. [ThaniSFn-V393] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 393) "He is a pure one": reading so suci with the Thai edition, a reading supported by the Chinese translation of the Dhp.

.. [ThaniSFn-V394] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 394) In India of the Buddha's day, matted hair, etc., were regarded as visible signs of spiritual status.

.. [ThaniSFn-V396] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 396) "Bho-sayer" — Brahmans addressed others as "bho" as a way of indicating their (the brahmans') superior caste. "If he has anything" (reading sa ce with the Burmese edition) = if he/she lays claim to anything as his/her own.

.. [ThaniSFn-V398] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 398) DhpA: strap = hatred; thong = craving; cord = 62 forms of wrong view (listed in the Brahmajala Suttanta, DN 1); bridle = obsessions (sensuality, becoming, anger, conceit, views, uncertainty, ignorance).

.. [ThaniSFn-V400] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 400) "With no overbearing pride": reading anussadam with the Thai and Burmese editions. "Last-body": see note 352.

.. [ThaniSFn-V402] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 402) "For himself, on his own, his own ending of stress": Three different ways that the one word attano functions in this verse.

.. [ThaniSFn-V411] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 411) According to DhpA, "attachments/homes (alaya)" = cravings. "Knowing": the knowledge of full Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V412] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 412) See note 39.

.. [ThaniSFn-V421] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 421) See note 348.

.. [ThaniSFn-V423] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 423) The forms of mastery listed in this verse correspond to the three knowledges that comprised the Buddha's Awakening: knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of how beings pass away and are reborn in the various levels of being, and knowledge of the ending of the effluents that maintain the process of birth.

.. [VaradoFn-V390] (Ven. Varado V.390) Verse 390: "As desires destructive (hiṃsamano) fade/ So his sorrows melt away": I assume, from the previous line, that 'mano' means 'desire of the mind for what's endearing'. This desire is destructive because of associated attachment. As desire fades, so his sorrows melt away.

.. [VaradoFn-V393_395-396] (Ven. Varado V.393_395-396) Verse 393, 395, 396: The word 'brahman' has various implied meanings, including religiosity, saintliness, godliness, divinity. I use these words interchangeably.

.. [VaradoFn-V396] (Ven. Varado V.396) Verse 396: as in verse 221: "free of all identity" (akiñcanaṃ). PED: having nothing.

.. [DLMBSFn-V383] (DLMBS Commentary V383) A certain Brahmin in Sāvatthi was a follower of the Buddha. Often he invited the monks to his house and he would address them as Arahants. Those monks, who had not yet attained the Arahantship, were embarrassed and many monks started to avoid the Brahmin's house. 

    The Brahmin felt sad and asked the Buddha why so many monks stopped coming to his house. The Buddha then questioned the monks and they told him about the Brahmin's form of address. The Buddha told them that the Brahmin did not mean anything bad; he spoke only out of his respect and devotion to the Arahants. Then the Buddha spoke this verse, saying that monks should uproot the stream of suffering, realize the destruction of conditioned things and experience the Nirvana.

.. [DLMBSFn-V384] (DLMBS Commentary V384) A group of monks once came to see the Buddha. Venerable Sāriputta perceived that those monks were very close to attaining the Arahantship. Therefore he approached the Buddha and asked him a question for the benefit of the monks. He asked, what were the two things that can bring about the disappearance of all bonds. The Buddha replied with this verse, adding that the two things were the tranquility and the insight meditations.

.. [DLMBSFn-V385] (DLMBS Commentary V385) Māra once approached the Buddha and asked him what does the word **pāra** (the other shore) mean. The Buddha knew that it was Māra and replied with this verse, saying that the other shore is the Nirvana, which only the Arahants can reach.

.. [DLMBSFn-V386] (DLMBS Commentary V386) Once a certain Brahmin thought that the Buddha always called his disciples "Brahmins" even though they were not Brahmins by caste. So he went to the Buddha and asked what he meant by "Brahmin". The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that one does not become a Brahmin by birth, but only by long and diligent practice of the Dharma.

.. [DLMBSFn-V387] (DLMBS Commentary V387) The king Pasenadi once came to see the Buddha. He was dressed in royal clothes, with all the regalia. He was very resplendent. In the congregation sat Venerable Kāludāyi, who was in deep meditation and his body was bright, as if emitting light. In the sky, the sun was setting and the moon was just rising, both of them radiating beautiful rays of light. 

    Venerable Ānanda observed all this and then he realized that the splendor of the Buddha is surpassing all others. He mentioned this and the Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the Buddha always shines by the power of morality, virtue, merit, wisdom and righteousness.

.. [DLMBSFn-V388] (DLMBS Commentary V388) Once a certain ascetic came to see the Buddha and asked him, if he (the Brahmin) could also be called "a monk" (**pabbajita**). The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that in order to be called "a monk" one has to discard all evil and impurities of mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V389] (DLMBS Commentary V389) Venerable Sāriputta was famous for his patience and forbearance. Once a certain Brahmin boasted he would provoke Sāriputta to anger. He came to Sāriputta while he was on his almsround and hit him on his back. Sāriputta did not even turn around but calmly continued on his way. The Brahmin felt very ashamed and begged Sāriputta for pardon. He then invited Sāriputta to his house for almsfood. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he praised Sāriputta with this verse (and the following one, DhP 390).

.. [DLMBSFn-V390] (DLMBS Commentary V390) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 389). 

    Whenever we are angry, but manage to turn away from the feelings of hatred and wish to hurt the opposite party, then we just won a small victory on the road towards the Awakenment and the appeasement of all suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V391] (DLMBS Commentary V391) Pajāpati Gotamī was the Buddha's stepmother. When Māyā, his own mother, died, Gotamī raised the young prince Siddhattha, the future Buddha, herself. Later, when her husband, the Buddha's father, died, she became the first nun and established the Sangha of the nuns (**bhikkhunī**). 

    Because she was the first nun, she was not ordained by the Sangha of the nuns, as was the rule. Therefore some nuns began to say that she was actually not nun at all and started to avoid her. 

    When the Buddha heard about this, he told them that he himself gave Pajāpati Gotamī her ordination and therefore she was a properly ordained nun. He further said, that Pajāpati Gotamī was an Arahant and added this verse to praise her qualities.

.. [DLMBSFn-V392] (DLMBS Commentary V392) Sāriputta and Moggallāna were friends ever since they were born. They grew up in one village, where their parents were Brahmins. Both youths searched for the teaching of Awakenment. They went to various teachers and performed various religious practices, but they were not satisfied. 

    When they were at Rājagaha, the Buddha also came there together with his monks. One of them was Venerable Assaji, one of the first five disciples of the Buddha. Sāriputta met Assaji while the later was on his almsround. Sāriputta was impressed with Assaji's calmness and serenity and asked him who was his teacher and what was his teaching. Assaji spoke a short verse: 

    "The Tathāgata (the Buddha) declared the cause and the cessation of all things that arise from a cause. This is what the Great Ascetic (The Buddha) says." 

    Sāriputta immediately attained the first level of Awakenment. He then went to inform Moggallāna about this and told him the verse. Moggallāna also attained the first stage of Awakenment. Together they went to see the Buddha and became monks. Soon they attained the Arahantship. Later they became the Buddha's chief disciples. 

    Venerable Sāriputta always remembered that it was Assaji who taught him the Dharma and used to pay his respect in the direction, where his teacher was. The other monks misunderstood this and reported to the Buddha that Sāriputta was still worshipping the directions as he had done before as a Brahmin. Sāriputta then explained that he only honored his teacher. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that we should always honor the person, who taught us the Dharma in the first place.

.. [DLMBSFn-V393] (DLMBS Commentary V393) A certain Brahmin heard the Buddha to call his disciples "Brahmins". He asked the Buddha if they were truly Brahmins by birth. The Buddha replied that one ought not to be called "a Brahmin" because of birth, lineage or matted hair. Only someone who comprehends the truth and knows the Dharma can be called "a Brahmin".

.. [DLMBSFn-V394] (DLMBS Commentary V394) There was a Brahmin, who climbed a tree near the city of Vesāli. He hanged down from it and told the people to bring him gifts - otherwise the city will suffer. Ignorant people indeed brought him many gifts, because they were superstitious and feared the powers of the Brahmin. 

    When the Buddha heard about it, he spoke this verse, saying that such "Brahmins" could fool only ignorant people.

.. [DLMBSFn-V395] (DLMBS Commentary V395) Sakka, the king of gods, once came to pay homage to the Buddha, with many lesser gods in attendance. At the same time, Kisā Gotamī, using her supernormal powers, flew to the Buddha also in order to pay homage to him. But when she saw Sakka with his entourage, she retreated. 

    Sakka asked the Buddha who she was and the Buddha told him Kisā Gotamī's story (see DhP 114 for the story). Then he spoke this verse, extolling virtues of meditation and ascetic livelihood.

.. [DLMBSFn-V396] (DLMBS Commentary V396) A certain Brahmin once asked Buddha why he called his disciples "Brahmins". Was it then not proper that he should be called "a Brahmin" too, since he was born from Brahmin parents? The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that a true Brahmin is one who overcame all his attachments, not the one who was born from Brahmin parents.

.. [DLMBSFn-V397] (DLMBS Commentary V397) Uggasena married a dancer and became an acrobat (see DhP 348 for the whole story). Once, while practicing on the long bamboo pole, he heard the Buddha's teachings and attained the Arahantship. Then he became a monk. 

    Later some monks questioned his attainment and asked the Buddha. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that Uggasena was truly an Arahant, without any fetters. 
  
    There are ten fetters (*saṃyojana*). They can be divided into two kinds, five so called "lower" or "big" fetters and five "higher" or "small" fetters. 

    The five big fetters are: 

    1) personality belief (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*), 
    2) skeptical doubt (*vicikicchā*), 
    3) clinging to rules and rituals (*sīlabbata-paramāsa*), 
    4) sensuous craving (*kāma-rāga*), 
    5) ill-will (*vyāpāda*).

    The five small fetters are: 

    1) craving for fine-material existence (*rūpa-rāga*), 
    2) craving for immaterial existence (*arūpa-rāga*), 
    3) conceit (*māna*), 
    4) restlessness (*uddhacca*), 
    5) ignorance (*avijjā*). 

.. [DLMBSFn-V398] (DLMBS Commentary V398) Two men from Sāvatthi owned oxen and they quarreled whose ox was stronger. So they filled a cart with sand and the two oxen tried to pull it. But the cart was so heavy that the oxen were able only to break the ropes and harnesses. The Buddha commented on the story with this verse, saying that we should cut the harnesses and fetters of our mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V399] (DLMBS Commentary V399) A certain Brahmin's wife was a follower of the Buddha and once she spoke the words in homage to the Buddha while her husband was entertaining some guests. He became very angry and decided to challenge the Buddha. He went to the monastery and asked the Buddha what do we have to kill in order to live peacefully and happily. The Buddha replied that we have to kill anger. The Brahmin immediately became a monk and later became an Arahant. 

    When his brother heard about this, he became furious and went to the monastery in order to abuse the Buddha. Before he got a chance to speak, the Buddha asked him, "If you invite the guests for dinner but they don't eat anything at all - to whom does the food belong?" The Brahmin replied that the food was then his. The Buddha continued, "In the same way, I do not accept your abuse, so it will go back to you." The Brahmin also became a monk and later attained the Arahantship. 

    Later also their two younger brothers came in anger to the Buddha, but also they were converted, became monks and later Arahants. 

    The monks commented how great were the powers of the Buddha, that he was able not only to stop the Brahmins from abuse, but also made them to became monks and Arahants. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that forbearance was the best weapon and power.

.. [DLMBSFn-V400] (DLMBS Commentary V400) Venerable Sāriputta and some monks went for almsfood in Nālaka village, where his family lived. His mother invited him and the monks into her house. But while she was serving them food, she was very rude to Sāriputta and also to the rest of the monks, because she was not happy about him becoming a monk. But Sāriputta borne the scolding patiently and without getting angry. Later the Buddha explained with this verse, that Arahants never loose their temper.

.. [DLMBSFn-V401] (DLMBS Commentary V401) Once some monks were discussing the story of the Arahant nun Uppalavaṇṇā who was raped in the forest (see DhP 69). In this connection they asked the Buddha if Arahants enjoy sensual pleasures or do not. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the Arahants do not enjoy sensual pleasures, because the do not cling to anything at all.

.. [DLMBSFn-V402] (DLMBS Commentary V402) A servant once escaped his master and became a monk, in due course reaching the Arahantship. Once when he was on an almsround with the Buddha, his former master saw him and tried grabbed him by his robe. But the Buddha explained that the man was not a servant any more, because he already escaped all kinds of enslavement by reaching the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V403] (DLMBS Commentary V403) The king of gods, Sakka came to pay homage to the Buddha once. At that time, the nun Khema came for the same purpose, using her supernormal powers, flying through the sky. But when she saw Sakka there, she left. Sakka asked the Buddha who this nun was. The Buddha described Khema with this verse, adding that she was foremost amongst the nuns as for wisdom.

.. [DLMBSFn-V404] (DLMBS Commentary V404) A monk named Tissa lived in a cave practicing meditation. In the same cave there lived a spirit who found it difficult to live near somebody of such pure virtue, yet didn't dare to ask Tissa directly to leave. 

    The spirit went to the nearby village and possessed a young boy. He then told the boy's mother that only after the boy is washed with water left over from washing Tissa's feet, would he leave the boy alone. The boy's mother asked Tissa for help and he agreed. 

    The spirit then accused Tissa of exorcism (the practice of which is an offence for Buddhist monks) and on account of this asked him to leave. Tissa reflected on his acts and realized that he did not practice exorcism and had no offence. That gave him assurance and happiness and he attained the Arahantship in that very spot. 

    Tissa continued to dwell in the cave for the whole Rain Retreat and when it was over, he went to see the Buddha. He narrated his encounter with the spirit and other monks asked the Buddha if Tissa was really an Arahant. The Buddha replied with this verse, confirming Tissa's attainment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V405] (DLMBS Commentary V405) One monk went to the forest for meditation practice. He attained the Arahantship and went to the Buddha to offer his gratitude. On the way he passed through a certain village. 

    There a wife quarreled with her husband and ran away. She followed close behind the monk. Her husband saw them and mistakenly thought that the monk is taking his wife away. So he beat the monk and took his wife back home. 

    When the monk returned to the Jetavana monastery, he told his story. Other monks asked him if he was angry. He replied he was not, because he has no anger left in him. The Buddha then confirmed with this verse that the monk has indeed reached the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V406] (DLMBS Commentary V406) A Brahmin couple once prepared to offer food to the Buddhist monks. The wife sent her husband to the monastery to invite some senior monks. But the Buddha sent four novices (who were also Arahants). The wife was unhappy, did not offer the novices neither seats nor food and sent her husband back. He met Venerable Sāriputta and brought him to their house. When Sāriputta saw the situation, he returned to the monastery. The same thing happened next time, when the Brahmin brought Venerable Moggallāna with him. 

    Sakka, the king of the gods, then took a form of an old Brahmin and came to the house. Husband and wife paid their respects to him and offered him the seat of honor. Sakka refused and paid respects to the four novices. Then he revealed that he was Sakka and the novices were actually Arahants. The Brahmin couple fell very ashamed and immediately served the novices food. 
    When the Buddha heard about this, he spoke this verse, saying that Arahants are not angry toward those, who are hostile.

.. [DLMBSFn-V407] (DLMBS Commentary V407) Two brothers, Mahāpanthaka and Cūḷapanthaka became monks. But whereas Mahāpanthaka soon became an Arahant, Cūḷapanthaka was quite dull and could not make any progress. His brother then suggested that maybe it would be better for him to return to the lay life. 

    The monks thought that he spoke out of anger and asked the Buddha if Arahants still have any anger left in them. The Buddha said that Mahāpanthaka acted as he thought was the best for his brother - there was no anger at all. 
    See also the story for gāthā 25.

.. [DLMBSFn-V408] (DLMBS Commentary V408) There was a monk named Pilinda Vaccha, who always addressed people in a offensive manner, as if he was somewhat superior. Other monks complained to the Buddha about it and he told them that Pilinda Vaccha had been born as a Brahmin for many past existences. Therefore, the way he addressed others was not meant as an offense (for Vaccha was an Arahant), but he did it simply out of force of habit. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that Arahants have no intention of harming others even with their speech.

.. [DLMBSFn-V409] (DLMBS Commentary V409) A certain Brahmin once put his clothes beside his house, in order to air it. A monk who happened to pass by mistook it for a thrown away piece of cloth and he took it. The Brahmin accused him of stealing and the monk then returned the cloth back and went to the monastery.

    There he told the story to other monks. The monks started joking about this incident, asking him to describe the quality of the cloth. The monks only replied that he had no attachment to the clothes at all. 

    The Buddha then confirmed that this monk was really an Arahant without attachment and added this verse, saying that Arahants do not take things not given to them.

.. [DLMBSFn-V410] (DLMBS Commentary V410) Venerable Sāriputta once spent a Rain Retreat at a certain village. The people there promised to give the monks all the requisites (robes etc.) at the end of the Retreat. However, when the Rains were over, not everything was received. So Sāriputta told the monks to send the villagers over to him in case they brought the requisites. 

    The monks misunderstood his intentions and told the Buddha that Sāriputta still had attachments to worldly thing like robes. The Buddha explained that Sāriputta's intention was to insure huge merit for the donors and enough of requisites for all the monks.

.. [DLMBSFn-V411] (DLMBS Commentary V411) On one occasion, a similar thing that happened to Venerable Sāriputta in the previous verse (see the commentary for gāthā 410) happened to Venerable Moggallāna. The Buddha then spoke this verse, saying that Moggallāna was free of defilements.

.. [DLMBSFn-V412] (DLMBS Commentary V412) One day the monks complained to the Buddha that a novice named Revata is getting many offerings from the people although he lives alone in the forest. They accused Revata of craving for material gains. The Buddha spoke this verse, saying that Revata has given up all cravings and is an Arahant.

.. [DLMBSFn-V413] (DLMBS Commentary V413) There lived a Brahmin in Sāvatthi called Candābha. In one of his previous lives he made offerings to the stūpa of the Buddha Kassapa. Because of this, a circle of light resembling the moon was radiating from his navel. Therefore he was called Candābha (moonlight). Some Brahmins took advantage of this and allowed people to touch Candābha for money. 

    Once they passed the Jetavana monastery and laughed at some disciples of the Buddha who were on the way to hear the Dharma. Then they took Candābha inside to compete with the Buddha. When Candābha was in the presence of the Buddha, his ring of light went out. Candābha then asked the Buddha to tech him how to make such marks appear and disappear. The Buddha told him to join the Order. 

    So Candābha became a monk and very soon he attained Arahantship and told his followers to go away, since he would no longer go with them around showing his navel. The Buddha then confirmed his attainment with this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V414] (DLMBS Commentary V414) A princess named Suppavāsa was pregnant for an unusually long time. She contemplated on the Three Jewels and then sent for the Buddha asking him for help. The Buddha recited, "May Suppavāsa be free from danger, may she give birth to a healthy son." Just as these words were said, Suppavāsa gave birth to a son. 

    When he grew up, he became a monk named Sivali. Very quickly he attaind the Arahantship and was then famous for being able to receive offerings without difficulty. 

    Once some monks asked why was his mother pregnant for such a long time. The Buddha said that in one of his previous life, Sivali was a prince who lost his kingdom and on an advice from his mother he besieged the city of his rival. As a result, the people of that city were hungry for several days. For this deed, Sivali and his mother had to suffer during the pregnancy and delivery.

.. [DLMBSFn-V415] (DLMBS Commentary V415) In Sāvatthi there lived a rich family. They had a son named Sundara Samudda. He became a monk and lived in Rājagaha. His family missed him very much and they rented a courtesan to try to tempt him. 

    She offered food to Sundara Samudda every day. Once she paid some children to play in the street and therefore she invited the monk inside her house, saying that it was too noisy and dusty outside. There she tried to tempt him to give up the life of a monk and become her husband. 

    The monk got very alarmed and realized his mistake. But the Buddha was mindful of this struggle and sent forth his radiance and spoke this verse to Sundara Samudda. The monk attained the Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V416] (DLMBS Commentary V416) This verse has two stories: 

    1) After the passing away of the previous Buddha (Kassapa) a monk went around for donations to build a stūpa. He came to a house, where a goldsmith was quarreling with his wife. The man scolded him and sent him away. Later he realized the wrong he committed and donated gold flowers to the stūpa. 

    In the present life he was a son of a rich woman who had an illicit affair. When he was born, his mother put him away. A young woman adopted him and named him Jaṭila. When he grew up, he married a daughter of a merchant and later discovered a large amount of gold in his house (as a result of donating the golden flowers). He had children and later he became a monk. He soon attained the Arahantship. 

    Later other monks asked him if he was still attached to his gold, to which he replied that he was not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Jaṭila's Arahantship. 

    2) In Rājagaha there lived a rich man named Jotika. Once he presented the prince Ajātasattu with a great ruby. Ajātasattu, seeing the beauty of his palace and his wealth, vowed to take Jotika's wealth away when he became a king. 

    Later Ajātasattu killed his father and became a king. He tried to break into Jotika's palace and loot it, but he was not successful. He went to ask the Buddha how that was possible, only to find Jotika sitting in the monastery and listening to the Buddha's discourse. Jotika explained that his property couldn't be taken from him against his wish. 

    Later Jotika became a monk and attained the Arahantship. Other monks asked him if he still missed his mansion and he replied that he did not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Jotika's Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V417] (DLMBS Commentary V417) A dancer named Nāṭa Puttaka once became a monk and attained the Arahantship. One day he and other monks saw another dancer in the streets, practicing his art. They asked Nāṭa Puttaka if he still missed dancing. He replied that he did not. The Buddha then spoke this verse, confirming Nāṭa Puttaka's Arahantship.

.. [DLMBSFn-V418] (DLMBS Commentary V418) The story for this verse as identical to the story for the previous one. See DhP 417.

.. [DLMBSFn-V419] (DLMBS Commentary V419) In Rājagaha there lived a Brahmin Vaṅgīsa who had a special knowledge. He would tap on the skull of a dead person and from that he could tell where that person had been reborn. 

    Once he heard that the Buddha also could tell the person's next birth so he came to contest the Buddha. 

    There were skulls of people reborn in hell, as animals, as human, as a god and the skull of an Arahant. Vaṅgīsa knew all of them -- except the last one. He asked the Buddha if he could teach him this skill. The Buddha told him to become a monk and that he will teach him. 

    As a monk, Vaṅgīsa soon attained the Awakenment and did not need this skill any more -- and told his friends that he had reached the Arahantship. The Buddha confirmed his attainment with this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V420] (DLMBS Commentary V420) The story for this verse as identical to the story for the previous one. See DhP 419.

.. [DLMBSFn-V421] (DLMBS Commentary V421) A man named Visākha from Sāvatthi heard a discourse of the Buddha and attained the third stage of Awakenment. He asked his wife Dhammadinnā for permission to become a monk. His wife did not accept his property, but instead decided to become a nun. Soon she attained the Arahantship. 

    Once the former husband and wife met and discussed the Dharma. Dhammadinnā would gladly discuss with him everything up to and including the third stage of Awakenment. But she would not talk about the full Arahantship, because, as she said, Visākha has not attained this yet. 

    The Buddha then confirmed with this verse that Dhammadinnā had attained the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V422] (DLMBS Commentary V422) The Kinf Pasenadi and Queen Mallikā once gave alms to the Buddha and Community. The offering was done on a big scale. There was an elephant holding an umbrella over each monk. Because there were many monks, one untrained elephant had to be used. He held an umbrella over Venerable Aṅgulimāla. Everybody was afraid that something would happen; however nothing did. 

    Later, other monks asked Aṅgulimāla if he was scared at that time. He replied that he was not, since he was an Arahant. The Buddha then confirmed Aṅgulimāla's attainment with this verse.

.. [DLMBSFn-V423] (DLMBS Commentary V423) The Buddha once suffered from some illness and asked a layman named Devahita for some water. Devahita was pleased and also sent some molasses. The Buddha had taken a bath and ate the molasses and felt better. 

    Devahita then came to visit the Buddha to ask an offering made to whom gives more benefit. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that the offering made to one who has given up all evil gives the most benefit.
