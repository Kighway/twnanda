        As long as evil has yet to ripen,

        But when that evil ripens,
        the fool falls into
                          pain.

**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn05-02]  (Ven. Nārada 05-02) Sahāyatā, According to the Commentary this term connotes higher morality, insight, Paths and Fruits of Sainthood. No such virtues are found in the foolish.

.. [NāradaFn05-03]  (Ven. Nārada 05-03) Out of compassion, to work for their betterment one may associate with the foolish but not be contaminated by them.

.. [NāradaFn05-04]  (Ven. Nārada 05-04) Madhu vā - in most texts

.. [NāradaFn05-05]  (Ven. Nārada 05-05) Literally month after month, with a kusa grass blade, a fool may eat his food.

.. [NāradaFn05-06]  (Ven. Nārada 05-06) Saṅkhatadhammānaṃ, "who have well weighed the Law", Max Muller and Burlingame. "Who well have taken things into account", Mrs. Rhys Davids. "Who have studied the Dhamma noble", Woodward. The commentarial explanation is: "The Ariyas who have realized the four Noble Truths".

                    The prolonged, so-called meritorious fasting of alien ascetics who have not destroyed the passions, is not worth the sixteenth part of a solitary day's fasting of an Ariya who has realized the four noble Truths.

.. [NāradaFn05-07]  (Ven. Nārada 05-07) That is, his wisdom.

.. [NāradaFn05-08]  (Ven. Nārada 05-08) Viveka, separation or detachment, is threefold, namely: bodily separation from the crowd (kāyaviveka), mental separation from passions (cittaviveka), and complete separation from all conditioned things which is Nibbāna (upadhiviveka).

.. [ThaniSFn-V71] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 71) "Doesn't — like ready milk — come out right away": All Pali recensions of this verse give the verb muccati — "to come out" or "to be released" — whereas DhpA agrees with the Sanskrit recensions in reading the verb as if it were mucchati/murchati, "to curdle." The former reading makes more sense, both in terms of the image of the poem — which contrasts coming out with staying hidden — and with the plain fact that fresh milk doesn't curdle right away. The Chinese translation of Dhp supports this reading, as do two of three scholarly editions of the Patna Dhp.
