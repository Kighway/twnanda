**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn16-14] (Ven. Nārada 16-14) The reference is to the Anāgāmis (Never-Returners) who, after death, are born in the Pure Abodes. They are not born in the sense-sphere as they have eradicated sense-desires.

.. [ThaniSFn-V209] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 209) This verse plays with the various meanings of yoga (task, striving, application, meditation) and a related term, anuyuñjati (keeping after something, taking someone to task). In place of the Pali reading attanuyoginam, "those who kept after themselves," the Patna Dhp reads atthanuyoginam, "those who kept after/remained devoted to the goal."

.. [ThaniSFn-V218] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 218) "The up-flowing stream": DhpA: the attainment of non-returning, the third of the four stages of Awakening (see note 22).

.. [ThaniSFn-V219] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 219) The Pali in these verses repeats the word "comes" three times, to emphasize the idea that if the results of meritorious actions await one after death, one's going to the next world is more like a homecoming.

.. [DLMBSFn-V209] (DLMBS Commentary V209) A young man from Sāvatthi became a monk. Both his parents were very strongly attached to their son, so they left home too. But even in the monastery they could not live without each other. They stayed together, ate together, all day only talking, as if they were still at home. When the Buddha heard this, he admonished them strongly that by becoming monks and a nun, they should leave behind all worldly attachments. He also told them this verse as well as the two following ones (DhP 210, DhP 211).

.. [DLMBSFn-V210] (DLMBS Commentary V210) The story of this verse is identical with the one for the previous (DhP 209) and the following (DhP 211) verses. 

                  Meeting people one does not like is truly suffering. Therefore we should avoid seeing them at all. But what about the ones we love? We suffer when they are away or when they die. So, it is best to avoid meeting them too and rather concentrate on the goal and meditate with strong effort.

.. [DLMBSFn-V211] (DLMBS Commentary V211) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the two previous ones (DhP 209, DhP 210). 

                  To be separated from the ones we love is painful. Therefore we should not hold anything dear. In this way, when we do not love or hate anything or anybody, there are no bonds for us and we can reach Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V212] (DLMBS Commentary V212) One rich man had a son and loved him very much. The son got ill and died. The man was extremely depressed. Every day he went to the cemetery and wept there. Once the Buddha met him there and asked what happened. The rich man told the Buddha about his son. 

                  The Buddha consoled him with this verse, saying that since everything and everybody must die, we should not be attached to people and things. The rich man immediately attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V213] (DLMBS Commentary V213) Visākhā, a famous benefactress of the Buddha and his followers, had a granddaughter, who died suddenly. Visākhā was very sad and she came to see the Buddha and expressed her feelings. The Buddha told her to realize how many people died every day only in the city of Sāvatthi. If we were to regard all of them as our children and grandchildren, we would be weeping all day. He also told Visākhā this verse, saying that sorrow arises out of love.

.. [DLMBSFn-V214] (DLMBS Commentary V214) Once the Buddha with some monks entered the city of Vesāli during a festival day. On their way they met some local princes, all dressed up in beautiful clothes. The Buddha told the monks to look at the princes, because they resemble the gods from Tāvatimsa heaven. 

                  On their way to the garden, the ptrinces met a beautiful courtesan. They invited her to join them. But they started to quarrel over her and soon they were fighting. At the end some of them had to be carried home bleeding. 

                  The Buddha told the monks this verse, saying that grief and sorrow are born from affection and sensual pleasures.

.. [DLMBSFn-V215] (DLMBS Commentary V215) In Sāvatthi there lived a young man named Anitthi Gandha Kumāra. He was to marry a beautiful young girl from Sāgala. But the bride got ill and died on her way to his house. The man became very sad, grieving all the time. 

                  The Buddha came to his house one day and after being offered almsfood, he asked for the reason of his sorrow. The young man told him the story of his ruined marriage. The Buddha replied him with this verse, saying that from pleasure and lust, only pain and sorrow can come out. The young man attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V216] (DLMBS Commentary V216) In Sāvatthi there lived a brahmin. He was not a follower of the Buddha. But because the Buddha knew he head the ability to attain the first stage of Awakenment, he went to the field where the brahmin was ploughing his field. The brahmin was very friendly and they talked many times. Every time the Buddha would visit him, the brahmin kept telling him he would offer him some rice after the harvest. The Buddha said nothing; because he knew this year the brahmin would get no harvest at all. 

                  One day there was a heavy rain and all the rice was destroyed. The brahmin was sad, because now he could not fulfill his promise. But the Buddha told him this verse, saying that only because of thirst and craving there is suffering and pain. The brahmin attained the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V217] (DLMBS Commentary V217) One day the Buddha with some monks went to the city of Rājagaha to obtain some almsfood. On the way they met a group of young boys with a basket full of cakes. The boys paid their respects to the Buddha but they did not offer him any cakes. 

                  Just then Venerable Kassapa came along. The boys immediately offered the cakes to him. Kassapa then advised the boys to offer some cakes to the Buddha and they did so. Later, some monks wondered why the boys liked Kassapa so much. The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that whoever has so many good qualities like Kassapa, is always liked by people and gods.

.. [DLMBSFn-V218] (DLMBS Commentary V218) There was an old monk who had many disciples. Many times they asked him about his attainments, but he never said anything. He has attained the third stage of Awakenment, but he decided he would not say anything, until he attained the full Awakenment. But he passed away without attaining the Arahantship and never told his pupils anything. 

                  The disciples thought their teacher had not attained any stage of Awakenment and fell very sorry. They asked the Buddha about this matter. The Buddha told him their teacher had actually attained the third stage, called Anāgāmi (never coming back again). He was reborn in high abodes of the Brahma heaven, never to come back to this world again. He would eventually reach the Awakenment there. The Buddha also told the students why their teacher never said anything - he was modest and also a bit ashamed he head not reached the full Arahantship. The Buddha also added this verse, describing their teacher.

.. [DLMBSFn-V219] (DLMBS Commentary V219) In the city of Benares there lived a rich man named Nandiya. Once he listened to the Buddha’s discourse on the benefits of giving. He built a monastery and furnished it. Immediately a mansion came up for him in the Tāvatimsa heaven, awaiting him. 

                  Venerable Moggallāna once visited the Tāvatimsa world and saw the mansion built there for Nandiya. When he returned back, he asked the Buddha about this. The Buddha replied with this verse (and the following one, DhP 220), saying that the good deeds await the well-doer in the next world as surely as the relatives and friends await somebody who is long away from home.

.. [DLMBSFn-V220] (DLMBS Commentary V220) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 219). 

                  Just like the rich man Nandiya from the story, we will reap the fruit of our good deeds - if not in this life, then in the next one. Our good deeds will "welcome" us immediately and we will be able to taste their outcome. Maybe we will have a mansion in heaven, like Nandiya. Or maybe we will be just a little bit wiser and more able to strive for our Awakenment.
