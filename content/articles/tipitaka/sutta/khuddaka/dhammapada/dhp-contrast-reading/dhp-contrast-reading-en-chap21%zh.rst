**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn21-01] (Ven. Nārada 21-01) Observance of morality, practise of meditation, etc.

.. [NāradaFn21-02] (Ven. Nārada 21-02) Such as decoration of umbrellas, sandals bowls, belts, etc.

.. [NāradaFn21-03] (Ven. Nārada 21-03) Contemplation on the loathsomeness of the body.

.. [NāradaFn21-04] (Ven. Nārada 21-04) Mātā = (mother) represents craving (taṇhā) as it produces birth.

.. [NāradaFn21-05] (Ven. Nārada 21-05) Pitā = (father) represents "I-conceit".

.. [NāradaFn21-06] (Ven. Nārada 21-06) Sānucaraṃ = (revenue officer) here represents clinging to life (nandirāga).

.. [NāradaFn21-07] (Ven. Nārada 21-07) Veyyagghapañcamaṃ, this term is used to denote the five hindrances (nīvaraṇa) of which doubt or indecision (vicikicchā) is the fifth. Veyyaggha means a perilous path infested with tigers. Doubt is comparable to such a path (Commentary). The other four hindrances are: sense-desire (kāmacchanda), ill-will (vyāpāda), restlessness and brooding (uddhacca-kukkucca), and slot and torpor (thīna-middha). They are called hindrances because they obstruct the path to heavenly bliss and Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn21-08] (Ven. Nārada 21-08) Reflection on the virtues of the Buddha, the Enlightened One.

.. [NāradaFn21-09] (Ven. Nārada 21-09) Reflection on the virtues of the Dhamma, the Teaching (of the Enlightened One).

.. [NāradaFn21-10] (Ven. Nārada 21-10) Reflection on the virtues of the Sangha, the Noble Order of Disciples (of the Enlightened One).

.. [NāradaFn21-11] (Ven. Nārada 21-11) Contemplation on the loathsomeness of the body.

.. [NāradaFn21-12] (Ven. Nārada 21-12) Saddhā trustful confidence based on knowledge. Buddhism has no place for blind faith.

.. [ThaniSFn-V293] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 293) Mindfulness immersed in the body = the practice of focusing on the body at all times simply as a phenomenon in and of itself, as a way of developing meditative absorption (jhana) and removing any sense of attraction to, distress over, or identification with the body. MN 119 lists the following practices as instances of mindfulness immersed in the body: mindfulness of breathing, awareness of the four postures of the body (standing, sitting, walking, lying down), alertness to all the actions of the body, analysis of the body into its 32 parts, analysis of it into its four properties (earth, water, fire, wind), and contemplation of the body's inevitable decomposition after death.

.. [ThaniSFn-V294] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 294) This verse and the one following it use terms with ambiguous meanings to shock the listener. According to DhpA, mother = craving; father = conceit; two warrior kings = views of eternalism (that one has an identity remaining constant through all time) and of annihilationism (that one is totally annihilated at death); kingdom = the twelve sense spheres (the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, feeling, and ideation, together with their respective objects); dependency = passions for the sense spheres.

.. [ThaniSFn-V295] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 295) DhpA: two learned kings = views of eternalism and annihilationism; a tiger = the path where the tiger goes for food, i.e., the hindrance of uncertainty, or else all five hindrances (sensual desire, ill will, torpor & lethargy, restlessness & anxiety, and uncertainty). However, in Sanskrit literature, "tiger" is a term for a powerful and eminent man; if that is what is meant here, the term may stand for anger.

.. [ThaniSFn-V299] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 299) See note 293.

.. [ThaniSFn-V301] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 301) "Developing the mind" in terms of the 37 Wings to Awakening: the four frames of reference (ardent, mindful alertness to body, feelings, mind states, and mental qualities in and of themselves), the four right exertions (to abandon and avoid evil, unskillful mental qualities, and to foster and strengthen skillful mental qualities), the four bases of power (concentration based on desire, persistence, intentness, and discrimination), the five strengths and five faculties (conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment), the seven factors for self-awakening (see note 89), and the noble eightfold path (see note 191). For a full treatment of this topic, see The Wings to Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V303] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 303) DhpA: Wealth = both material wealth and the seven forms of noble wealth (ariya-dhana): conviction, virtue, shame, compunction (at the thought of doing evil), erudition, generosity, discernment.
