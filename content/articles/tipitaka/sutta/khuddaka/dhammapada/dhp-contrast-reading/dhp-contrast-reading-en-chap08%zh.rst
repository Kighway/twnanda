**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn08-03] (Ven. Nārada 08-03) Sahassaṃ sahassena, thousand multiplied by a thousand, that is, ten lakhs. (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn08-04] (Ven. Nārada 08-04) Atta -The Buddha often uses this term in the sense of oneself or mind but not in the sense of a soul or special self.

.. [NāradaFn08-05] (Ven. Nārada 08-05) A class of beings who are supposed to be heavenly musicians.

.. [NāradaFn08-06] (Ven. Nārada 08-06) Here Māra is used in the sense of god.

.. [NāradaFn08-07] (Ven. Nārada 08-07) Another class of beings, even superior to the gods in heaven, who have developed the Jhānas (ecstasies).

.. [NāradaFn08-08] (Ven. Nārada 08-08) According to the Commentary iññhaṃ is that which is given on festival occasions, and hutaṃ is that which is prepared and given either to guests or with a belief in kamma and results. The idea conveyed by this stanza is that reverence paid to a Saint is far superior to gifts and alms given to worldlings.

.. [NāradaFn08-09] (Ven. Nārada 08-09) They are the Sotāpannas (Stream-Winners) and others who have attained sanctification.

.. [NāradaFn08-10] (Ven. Nārada 08-10) Nirodha-samāpatti. This is a state when the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases to flow. When in such a state, a Saint is immune from danger.

.. [NāradaFn08-11] (Ven. Nārada 08-11) The rise and decay of mind and matter - namely: the impermanence of all conditioned things. A disciple of the Buddha is expected to contemplate the fleeting nature of life, so that he may not be attached to illusory material pleasures.

.. [NāradaFn08-12] (Ven. Nārada 08-12) Amataṃ padaṃ, the unconditioned state of Nibbāna, free from birth, decay and death.

.. [NāradaFn08-13] (Ven. Nārada 08-13) The nine supramundane States - namely: the four Paths, the four Fruits, and Nibbāna.

.. [BudRkFn-v104]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 104) Brahma: a high divinity in ancient Indian religion.

.. [ThaniSFn-V100] (Ven. Thanissaro V.100) According to DhpA, the word sahassam in this and the following verses means "by the thousands" rather than "a thousand." The same principle would also seem to hold for satam — "by the hundreds" rather than "a hundred" — in 102.

.. [ThaniSFn-V108] (Ven. Thanissaro V.108) "Doesn't come to a fourth": DhpA: The merit produced by all sacrificial offerings given in the world in the course of a year doesn't equal even one fourth of the merit made by paying homage once to one who has gone the straight way to Unbinding.
