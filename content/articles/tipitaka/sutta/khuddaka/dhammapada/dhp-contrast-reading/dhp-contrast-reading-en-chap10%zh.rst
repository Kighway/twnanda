       |  Like a horse one might train  
       |  That’s aroused with a cane, 
       |  You must smother your vast tribulation: 
       |    
       |  Be zealous, one-pointed and cultivate purity; 
       |  Trust, have composure, be mindful, have energy! 
       |  Blessed with discernment, 
       |  Endowed with good conduct,  
       |  Make effort in Dhamma enquiry.

     - 144 Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip, be ye active and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof), perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.

**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn10-01] (Ven. Nārada 10-01) Na haneyya na ghātaye = na pahareyya na paharāpeyya (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn10-02] (Ven. Nārada 10-02) One who follows this exemplary practice, even though not yet having attained Nibbāna, is regarded as having attained Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn10-03] (Ven. Nārada 10-03) Here the herdsman resembles decay and death.

.. [NāradaFn10-04] (Ven. Nārada 10-04) The cattle resemble life.

.. [NāradaFn10-05] (Ven. Nārada 10-05) The pasture ground resembles death.

.. [NāradaFn10-06] (Ven. Nārada 10-06) Namely: the Arahats who are weaponless and innocent.

.. [NāradaFn10-07] (Ven. Nārada 10-07) That might cause death.

.. [NāradaFn10-08] (Ven. Nārada 10-08) Loss in business transactions, loss of wealth etc.

.. [NāradaFn10-09] (Ven. Nārada 10-09) Gymnosophism is still practised in India. External dirtiness is regarded by some as a mark of saintliness. The Buddha denounces strict asceticism confined to such externals. The members of His celibate Order follow the middle path, avoiding the extremes of self-mortification and self-indulgence. Simplicity, humility, and poverty should be the chief characteristics of bhikkhus as much as cleanliness.

.. [NāradaFn10-10] (Ven. Nārada 10-10) Unwashed matted hair is regarded by the foolish as a mark of holiness.

.. [NāradaFn10-11] (Ven. Nārada 10-11) The non-cleansing of teeth, smearing the body with mud, etc.

.. [NāradaFn10-12] (Ven. Nārada 10-12) Fasting alone does not tend to purification. The bhikkhus too fast daily between midday and the following dawn.

.. [NāradaFn10-13] (Ven. Nārada 10-13) Sleeping on the ground. Bhikkhus only avoid luxurious and high couches.

.. [NāradaFn10-14] (Ven. Nārada 10-14) Through not bathing.

.. [NāradaFn10-15] (Ven. Nārada 10-15) Rubbing the body with ashes is still practised by some ascetics.

.. [NāradaFn10-16] (Ven. Nārada 10-16) Continually sitting and wandering in that posture.

.. [NāradaFn10-17] (Ven. Nārada 10-17) With regard to the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, etc.

.. [NāradaFn10-18] (Ven. Nārada 10-18) Niyata. The four Paths are: Sotāpatti (Stream-Winner), Sakadāgāmi (Once-Returner), Anāgāmi (Never-Returner) and Arahatta (Worthy).

.. [NāradaFn10-19] (Ven. Nārada 10-19) Mrs. Rhys Davids: "Walking in God", a very misleading phrase, totally foreign to Buddhism. The commentarial explanation is seññhacariya - highest conduct.

.. [NāradaFn10-20] (Ven. Nārada 10-20) Absolutely harmless towards all.

.. [NāradaFn10-21] (Ven. Nārada 10-21) Because he has cast aside impurities.

.. [NāradaFn10-22] (Ven. Nārada 10-22) Samaṇa, because he has cleansed himself of all impurities.

.. [NāradaFn10-23] (Ven. Nārada 10-23) Bhikkhu, because he has destroyed passions.

.. [NāradaFn10-24] (Ven. Nārada 10-24) A gaily decked minister, stricken with grief, listened to the Buddha, seated on an elephant. On hearing the discourse, he realized Arahantship. Simultaneous with his realization his death occurred. The Buddha then advised his followers to pay him the respect due to an Arahant. When the bhikkhus questioned him how the minister could have attained Arahantship in such elegant dress the Buddha uttered this verse to show that purity comes from within and not from without. In striking contrast to the former this verse clearly indicates the Buddhist view of a holy person. It is not the apparel that counts but internal purity.

.. [NāradaFn10-25] (Ven. Nārada 10-25) A self-respecting bhikkhu or layman, when obsessed with evil thoughts, tries to eradicate them there and then. This verse indicates that such persons are rare.

.. [NāradaFn10-26] (Ven. Nārada 10-26) Vijjācaraṇa. Eight kinds of Knowledge and fifteen kinds of Conduct.

                    The eight kinds of Knowledge are: (1) Psychic Powers (iddhividha), (2) Divine Ear (dibba-sota), (3) Penetration of the minds of others (ceto-pariya-ñāṇa), (4) Divine Eye (dibba-cakkhu), (5) Remembrance of former births (pubbe-nivāsanussati), (6) Extinction of corruptions (āsavakkhaya), (7) Insight (vipassanā) and (8) Creation of mental images (manomayiddhi).

                    The fifteen kinds of Conduct are:- Moral restraint, sense-restraint, moderation in eating, wakefulness, faith, moral shame, moral dread, great learning, energy, mindfulness, wisdom and the four Jhānas.

.. [NāradaFn10-27] (Ven. Nārada 10-27) Cf. v. 80.

.. [ThaniSFn-V143] (Ven. Thanissaro V.143) Some translators have proposed that the verb apabodheti, here translated as "awakens" should be changed to appam bodheti, "to think little of." This, however, goes against the sense of the verse and of a recurrent image in the Canon, that the better-bred the horse, the more sensitive it is even to the idea of the whip, to say nothing of the whip itself. See, for example, A 4.113.

                     The question raised in this verse is answered in SN 1.18:
                     ::

                      Those restrained by conscience
                       are rare —
                      those who go through life
                       always mindful.
                      Having reached the end
                       of suffering & stress,
                      they go through what is uneven
                          evenly;
                       go through what is out-of-tune
                          in tune.

.. [VaradoFn-V129] (Ven. Varado V. 129) Verse 129: ghataye can mean either 'kill' or 'cause to be killed'. See PED under ghateti and hanati.
