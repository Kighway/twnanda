    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn14-01] (Ven. Nārada 14-01) As the Buddha had eradicated all passions of lust, hatred, and delusion they could not arise in Him any more. His spiritual victory was unconquerable.

.. [NāradaFn14-02] (Ven. Nārada 14-02) Because the eradicated passions do not arise again.

.. [NāradaFn14-03] (Ven. Nārada 14-03) Since the Buddha is devoid of the tracks (pada) of lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn14-04] (Ven. Nārada 14-04) Being omniscient.

.. [NāradaFn14-05] (Ven. Nārada 14-05) Of lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn14-06] (Ven. Nārada 14-06) Nessatha = will lead to temptation by bringing under the sway of the tempters.

.. [NāradaFn14-07] (Ven. Nārada 14-07) Here Jhāna means both concentration (samatha) and insight (vipassanā).

.. [NāradaFn14-08] (Ven. Nārada 14-08) Nekkhamma implies Nibbāna, which is gained by the subjugation of passions.

.. [NāradaFn14-09] (Ven. Nārada 14-09) What is associated with the three immoral roots of attachment (lobha), ill-will (dosa), and delusion (moha) is evil. What is associated with the three moral roots of generosity (alobha), goodwill or loving-kindness (adosa) and wisdom (amoha) is good.

.. [NāradaFn14-10] (Ven. Nārada 14-10) The religion of the Buddha is summarised in this verse.

.. [NāradaFn14-11] (Ven. Nārada 14-11) Pabbajito, one who casts aside his impurities and has left the world.

.. [NāradaFn14-12] (Ven. Nārada 14-12) Samaṇo, one who has subdued his passions, an ascetic.

.. [NāradaFn14-13] (Ven. Nārada 14-13) Pātimokkha, these are the 220 chief rules (excluding the seven ways of settling disputes) which every bhikkhu is expected to observe.

.. [NāradaFn14-14] (Ven. Nārada 14-14) Adhicitta, namely: the eight attainments (aññhasamāpatti), the four rūpa jhānas and the four arūpa jhānas. They are higher stages of mental concentration which enable one to gain supernormal powers.

.. [NāradaFn14-15] (Ven. Nārada 14-15) One's best refuge is oneself. A Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha as the Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught in order to gain his deliverance from the ills of life. The Buddha is the supreme teacher who shows the way to deliverance. The Dhamma is the unique way. The Sangha represents the Taught who have followed the way and have become living examples. One formally becomes a Buddhist by intelligently seeking refuge in this Triple Gem (Tisaraṇa). A Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the hope that he will be saved by a personal act of deliverance. The confidence of a Buddhist in the Buddha is like that of a sick person in a noted physician, or of a student in his teacher.

.. [NāradaFn14-16] (Ven. Nārada 14-16) That is, a Buddha.

.. [NāradaFn14-17] (Ven. Nārada 14-17) Sangha is the oldest, democratically constituted, historic, celibate Order, founded by the Buddha. Strictly speaking, the Sangha denotes those noble disciples who have realized the four Paths and four Fruits. The ordinary bhikkhus of the present day are merely their representatives.

.. [NāradaFn14-18] (Ven. Nārada 14-18) Papañca = impediments or obstacles such as attachment, false views and pride.

.. [NāradaFn14-19] (Ven. Nārada 14-19) Those who have extinguished the fire of lust.

.. [NāradaFn14-20] (Ven. Nārada 14-20) The passionless are fearless.

.. [BudRkFn-v190-191] (Ven. Buddharakkhita vv. 190-191) The Order: both the monastic Order (bhikkhu sangha) and the Order of Noble Ones (ariya sangha) who have reached the four supramundane stages.

.. [ThaniSFn-V183-185] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 183-185) These verses are a summary of a talk called the Ovada Patimokkha, which the Buddha is said to have delivered to an assembly of 1,250 arahants in the first year after his Awakening. Verse 183 is traditionally viewed as expressing the heart of the Buddha's teachings.

.. [ThaniSFn-V191] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 191) The noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

.. [ThaniSFn-V195-196] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 195-196) Objectification = papañca. Alternative translations of this term would be proliferation, elaboration, exaggeration, complication. The term is used both in philosophical contexts — in connection with troubles and conflict — and in artistic contexts, in connection with the way in which an artistic theme is objectified and elaborated. Sn 4.14 states that the classifications of objectification begin with the perception by which one objectifies oneself — "I am thinker" — and then spread to objectify the rest of experience around the issues caused by that perception. MN 18 explains how this leads to conflict: "Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one objectifies. Based on what a person objectifies, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye. [Similarly with the other senses.]... Now, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person: if there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of obsession with passion, irritation, views, uncertainty, conceit, passion for becoming, & ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive tale-bearing, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful actions cease without remainder."

.. [VaradoFn-V181] (Ven. Varado V.181)  Verse 181: "gods would wish their situation" (devāpi tesaṃ pihayanti). PED says pihayanti means desire or envy.
