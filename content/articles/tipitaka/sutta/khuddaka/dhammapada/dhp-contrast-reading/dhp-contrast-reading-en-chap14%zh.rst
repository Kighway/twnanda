          If you worship those worthy of worship,

     - 195, 196. He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be measured by anybody.

.. [NāradaFn14-01] (Ven. Nārada 14-01) As the Buddha had eradicated all passions of lust, hatred, and delusion they could not arise in Him any more. His spiritual victory was unconquerable.

.. [NāradaFn14-02] (Ven. Nārada 14-02) Because the eradicated passions do not arise again.

.. [NāradaFn14-03] (Ven. Nārada 14-03) Since the Buddha is devoid of the tracks (pada) of lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn14-04] (Ven. Nārada 14-04) Being omniscient.

.. [NāradaFn14-05] (Ven. Nārada 14-05) Of lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn14-06] (Ven. Nārada 14-06) Nessatha = will lead to temptation by bringing under the sway of the tempters.

.. [NāradaFn14-07] (Ven. Nārada 14-07) Here Jhāna means both concentration (samatha) and insight (vipassanā).

.. [NāradaFn14-08] (Ven. Nārada 14-08) Nekkhamma implies Nibbāna, which is gained by the subjugation of passions.

.. [NāradaFn14-09] (Ven. Nārada 14-09) What is associated with the three immoral roots of attachment (lobha), ill-will (dosa), and delusion (moha) is evil. What is associated with the three moral roots of generosity (alobha), goodwill or loving-kindness (adosa) and wisdom (amoha) is good.

.. [NāradaFn14-10] (Ven. Nārada 14-10) The religion of the Buddha is summarised in this verse.

.. [NāradaFn14-11] (Ven. Nārada 14-11) Pabbajito, one who casts aside his impurities and has left the world.

.. [NāradaFn14-12] (Ven. Nārada 14-12) Samaṇo, one who has subdued his passions, an ascetic.

.. [NāradaFn14-13] (Ven. Nārada 14-13) Pātimokkha, these are the 220 chief rules (excluding the seven ways of settling disputes) which every bhikkhu is expected to observe.

.. [NāradaFn14-14] (Ven. Nārada 14-14) Adhicitta, namely: the eight attainments (aññhasamāpatti), the four rūpa jhānas and the four arūpa jhānas. They are higher stages of mental concentration which enable one to gain supernormal powers.

.. [NāradaFn14-15] (Ven. Nārada 14-15) One's best refuge is oneself. A Buddhist seeks refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha as the Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught in order to gain his deliverance from the ills of life. The Buddha is the supreme teacher who shows the way to deliverance. The Dhamma is the unique way. The Sangha represents the Taught who have followed the way and have become living examples. One formally becomes a Buddhist by intelligently seeking refuge in this Triple Gem (Tisaraṇa). A Buddhist does not seek refuge in the Buddha with the hope that he will be saved by a personal act of deliverance. The confidence of a Buddhist in the Buddha is like that of a sick person in a noted physician, or of a student in his teacher.

.. [NāradaFn14-16] (Ven. Nārada 14-16) That is, a Buddha.

.. [NāradaFn14-17] (Ven. Nārada 14-17) Sangha is the oldest, democratically constituted, historic, celibate Order, founded by the Buddha. Strictly speaking, the Sangha denotes those noble disciples who have realized the four Paths and four Fruits. The ordinary bhikkhus of the present day are merely their representatives.

.. [NāradaFn14-18] (Ven. Nārada 14-18) Papañca = impediments or obstacles such as attachment, false views and pride.

.. [NāradaFn14-19] (Ven. Nārada 14-19) Those who have extinguished the fire of lust.

.. [NāradaFn14-20] (Ven. Nārada 14-20) The passionless are fearless.

.. [BudRkFn-v190-191] (Ven. Buddharakkhita vv. 190-191) The Order: both the monastic Order (bhikkhu sangha) and the Order of Noble Ones (ariya sangha) who have reached the four supramundane stages.

.. [ThaniSFn-V183-185] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 183-185) These verses are a summary of a talk called the Ovada Patimokkha, which the Buddha is said to have delivered to an assembly of 1,250 arahants in the first year after his Awakening. Verse 183 is traditionally viewed as expressing the heart of the Buddha's teachings.

.. [ThaniSFn-V191] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 191) The noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

.. [ThaniSFn-V195-196] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 195-196) Objectification = papañca. Alternative translations of this term would be proliferation, elaboration, exaggeration, complication. The term is used both in philosophical contexts — in connection with troubles and conflict — and in artistic contexts, in connection with the way in which an artistic theme is objectified and elaborated. Sn 4.14 states that the classifications of objectification begin with the perception by which one objectifies oneself — "I am thinker" — and then spread to objectify the rest of experience around the issues caused by that perception. MN 18 explains how this leads to conflict: "Dependent on eye & forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. What one feels, one perceives [labels in the mind]. What one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one objectifies. Based on what a person objectifies, the perceptions & categories of objectification assail him/her with regard to past, present, & future forms cognizable via the eye. [Similarly with the other senses.]... Now, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions & categories of objectification assail a person: if there is nothing there to relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of obsession with passion, irritation, views, uncertainty, conceit, passion for becoming, & ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods & bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive tale-bearing, & false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful actions cease without remainder."

.. [VaradoFn-V181] (Ven. Varado V.181)  Verse 181: "gods would wish their situation" (devāpi tesaṃ pihayanti). PED says pihayanti means desire or envy. 

.. [DLMBSFn-V179] (DLMBS Commentary V179) In the Kuru country there lived a Brahmin named Māgandiya. He had a very beautiful daughter. Many young men desired to marry her, but her father turned all of them down, thinking they were not good enough for her. 

                  One morning, Māgandiya went to perform his daily fire worship. On the way he met the Buddha. Immediately he decided, that the Buddha would be an ideal husband for his daughter. Quickly he returned home and took his wife and daughter with him back to the place he met the Buddha. 

                  In the meantime, the Buddha left his footprints at that place and went to another spot nearby. When Māgandiya's wife saw the footprints, she remarked, that these footprints belong to somebody, who has given up all cravings. But her husband did not pay any attention to that and proceeded to find the Buddha and offer his daughter to him. 

                  The Buddha said he was not interested. He told them how the beautiful daughters of Māra tried to seduce him. He gave up all passions, all cravings, and all attachments. Even when he saw the most beautiful women - the daughters of Māra, he felt no desire. Compared with them, Māgandiya's daughter was nothing - why should he want even to touch her? 

                  Both the Brahmin and his wife attained the third stage of Awakenment on hearing these words. Later they became a monk and a nun and soon attained Arahantship. But their daughter, Māgandiya, felt insulted and promised to take revenge on the Buddha.

.. [DLMBSFn-V180] (DLMBS Commentary V180) The commentarial story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous verse (see DhP 179). 

                  As the Buddha has eradicated all cravings, destroyed all roots of evil, these cannot "lead" him anywhere, there are no more rebirths for him. Nobody can trace him or destroy him.

.. [DLMBSFn-V181] (DLMBS Commentary V181) Once, when the Buddha was staying in Sāvatthi, he was challenged by some other ascetics to perform a miracle. He therefore performed the Twin Miracle and proceeded to the Tāvatimsa heaven to teach Abhidharma there. His mother had been reborn in the Tusita heaven, but went to Tāvatimsa to learn the Teaching. After hearing the Dharma from the Buddha, his mother together with many other gods reached the first level of Awakenment. 

                  The Buddha spent three months in Tāvatimsa. Venerable Sāriputta was spending the Rain Retreat in Samkassa and taught the Abhidharma, as the Buddha instructed him. At the end of the Retreat Venerable Moggallāna went to Tāvatimsa to see the Buddha and was informed that the Buddha would be coming back to Samkassa on the fool moon day at the end of the Rain Retreat. 

                  On that day the Buddha appeared, six colored rays shining from his body. A great number of gods accompanied him and paid his homage to him before they left. Sāriputta exclaimed how magnificent the gods looked and how extraordinary that both human beings and gods respect the Buddha so much. 

                  The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that indeed even the gods envy a buddha his qualities.

.. [DLMBSFn-V182] (DLMBS Commentary V182) During the times of the past Buddha Kassapa, there was a monk. Once he committed a wrong deed and was tormented by regret. He was not able to overcome this and concentrate on his practice. Therefore he made no progress and was reborn as a Nāga. Nāgas are mythological beings, snakes that can change into humans. They are believed to have miraculous powers. 

                  This Nāga's name was Erakapatta. He had a beautiful daughter. He announced that whoever could answer her questions, could marry her. Many young men tried but nobody was successful. 

                  Once a young man named Uttara was on his way to try to answer the questions. The Buddha saw that he was very close to attaining the first stage of Awakenment, therefore he taught him answers to the questions. Immediately, Uttara attained the first stage. As a result, he had no longer desire for the Nāga princess. But he still went there to answer her questions.

                  | The girl asked: "Who is a ruler? 
                  | Uttara replied: "Who controls his six senses." 
                  | "Is someone overpowered by moral defilements to be called a ruler?" 
                  | "No, only who is free from moral defilements can be called a ruler." 
                  | "What ruler is free from moral defilements?" 
                  | "One who is free from selfishness." 
                  | "Who is to be called a fool?" 
                  | "One who strives after sensual pleasures is a fool." 

                  Uttara then answered many more questions. When Erakapatta found out that somebody was able to answer, he realized that a Buddha was again in this world. He asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. There he paid homage to the Buddha and related his story. 

                  The Buddha replied with this verse, saying that it is extremely rare to be born as a human being, and even rarer to be able to hear the Dharma from the mouth of a Buddha. 

                  At the end of the discourse many monks attained Arahantship or at least the first stage of Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V183] (DLMBS Commentary V183) This gatha, simply said, is Buddhism in a nutshell. Truly, what can be explained and expanded in hundreds of books, can be also abbreviated into three main guidelines. Not doing evil deeds - the first step on the road to Awakenment. But what exactly are "evil deeds"? A deed is considered evil if it brings suffering to any living being.

                  After one refrains from doing evil deeds one needs to do good deeds - to "gather" them like flowers. Good deeds are deeds that help living beings. They are based on loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. In order to be able to do so, one must cultivate these feelings in one's heart and mind.

                  These two steps are only preparatory stages to the final and most important action - purification of mind. The first two stages are here to prepare our mind for the highest goal. Without them it would be indeed impossible to purify our minds, for a mind that harbors evil thoughts can not purify itself.

                  The last verse mentions that this is the teaching of the buddhas. Why is the plural form used here? The historical Buddha Shakyamuni is believed to be just one from the long succession of Awakened beings, buddhas, who reach the nirvana by themselves and the become teachers of the Dharma. And as this verse states, their teachings might differ, but these three basic patterns do not change in either of them. Therefore, these lines can truly be described as the very core of Buddha's teaching.

.. [DLMBSFn-V184] (DLMBS Commentary V184) Venerable Ānanda  once asked the Buddha if the basic instructions for the behavior of the monks were the same in case of the past Buddhas, or if each Awakened One sets his own rules. 

                  The Buddha replied with this verse and with the preceding one (DhP 183) and with the following one (DhP 185), saying that they were all the same. He also added that the previous Buddhas uttered these three verses also.

.. [DLMBSFn-V185] (DLMBS Commentary V185) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous two verses (DhP 183, DhP 184). These three verses have been recited by the Buddhas of all times. It is a simple and basic summarization of most essential Buddhist teaching. Wanting little, content, not hurting others, moral life in seclusion and meditation in order to reach the highest goal, the Nirvana, complete freedom and emancipation of the mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V186] (DLMBS Commentary V186) At the Jetavana monastery there was a young monk. His teacher sent him to another monastery to practice meditation. While he was away, his father died and left some money for him with his brother. When the monk returned, he found out about this, but decided to continue living as a monk and told his brother to keep the money for himself. 

                  Later, however, he began to regret, started to imagine his comfortable life as a layman with that amount of money. He became dissatisfied with his life as a monk and began loosing weight. Other monks persuaded him to seek help from the Buddha. 

                  The Buddha told the monk this verse (and the following one, see DhP 187), saying that there is simply never enough money to satisfy the hunger. He told him the story of a king named Mandhātu, who had been a Universal Monarch a long time ago. He was reborn in Tavatimsa heaven and enjoyed immense riches and power for a long time. Then he started to wish he were the only ruler of Tavatimsa instead of Sakka, the king of the gods. Immediately he died and fell down from his heavenly state. 

                  The young monk decided to continue his life as a monk and strived diligently to attain the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V187] (DLMBS Commentary V187) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 187). 

                  It is a well-known fact that people are never satisfied with what they have. Even millionaires want to become billionaires; even kings want to become emperors. So the Buddha's message is rather simple: be satisfied with little and rather strive for the spiritual perfection, do not wish for worldly possessions.

.. [DLMBSFn-V188] (DLMBS Commentary V188) When the father of the king Pasenadi of Kosala, Mahā Kosala, was reigning, he had a head priest, named Aggidatta. When Mahā Kosala died, Aggidatta gave up his position and wealth and became an ascetic. He had many followers and lived on the border of Anga, Magadha and Kuru countries. His teaching to the people was: pay homage to forests, mountains, trees and shrines. By doing so, you will be freed from all evils. 

                  Once the Buddha sent Venerable Moggallāna to teach the Dharma to Aggidatta. When Moggallāna arrived, he asked for a place to spend the night. They refused to let him stay with them. Close to that place was a cave where lived a very powerful Nagā and Aggidatta sent Moggallāna there, thinking Nagā would kill him. Moggallāna and the Nagā had a duel, but at the end the Nagā was subdued and spread his hood over Moggallāna's head, showing him respect. 

                  In the morning, Aggidatta and his pupils went to the cave to find out what happened. When they saw the Nagā holding his head over Moggallāna, they were surprised and paid respects to Moggallāna. 

                  When the Buddha arrived there, Moggallāna got up from his seat and paid homage to the Buddha, saying that he was only a disciple, the Buddha was his teacher. When Aggidatta heard that, his respect for the Buddha was only greater. The Buddha admonished them with this verse (and following ones, DhP 189, DhP 190, DhP 191, DhP 192), saying that trees and mountains are not a real refuge; only the Three Gems (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) are the highest refuge. 

                  Aggidatta and his pupils attained Arahantship immediately. They all became monks. Later, lay disciples of Aggidatta came to that place and were confused. Who was more powerful? Aggidatta or the Buddha? Aggidatta got up from his seat and paid homage to the Buddha, saying that he was only a humble disciple, the Buddha was the highest teacher.

.. [DLMBSFn-V189] (DLMBS Commentary V189) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verse (DhP 188) and the following ones (DhP 190, DhP 191, DhP 192). 

                  Trees or mountains are not liberated from the round of rebirths. Neither are the protective gods that may inhabit them. Therefore, taking these things as a refuge will not help us in the goal, liberation of mind from the round of rebirths, the Samsāra.

.. [DLMBSFn-V190] (DLMBS Commentary V190) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP 188, DhP 189) and the following ones (DhP 191, DhP 192). 

                  The Triple Gem, the Buddha (Awakened One), the Dharma (his teaching) and the Sangha (the community of his followers) are the highest possible refuge, because the Buddha has reached Awakenment, the Dharma is the teaching how to reach this goal and the Sangha is the community of people who are on the way to reach it. 

                  Having taken refuge in this Triple Gem, one can clearly see the Four Noble Truths, the most important of all the Buddhist teachings. They are: 1) The truth of Suffering, 2) The truth of Origin of Suffering, 3) The truth of Extinction of Suffering and 4) The truth of the Path, leading to the Extinction of Suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V191] (DLMBS Commentary V191) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP 188, DhP 189, DhP 190) and the following one (DhP 192). 

                  These are so called Four Noble Truths, one of the most important teachings of the Buddha. They are:

                  1) The Truth of Suffering: everything in this world is connected with pain and suffering. 

                  2) The truth of Origin of Suffering: the root of suffering is our craving. 

                  3) The truth of Extinction of Suffering: by destroying the craving we also destroy all the suffering. 

                  4) The truth of the Path, leading to the Extinction of Suffering: this can be done by following the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.

.. [DLMBSFn-V192] (DLMBS Commentary V192) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the preceding verses (DhP 188, DhP 189, DhP 190, DhP 191). 

                  Because the Buddha is free from the round of rebirths, his teaching can lead us in the same direction. And in the community of his followers we can help each other to reach this goal. Then we will be able to see the Four Noble Truths and lead our lives according to the Noble Eightfold Path. If we mindfully strive for the highest goal, surely we will reach it. 

                  Therefore, the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are the highest possible refuge, because by following them, we can attain the Awakenment and reach freedom from suffering and the round of rebirths.

.. [DLMBSFn-V193] (DLMBS Commentary V193) Venerable Ānanda was once pondering about what the Buddha said. Thoroughbreds of elephants are born only amongst Chaddanta and Uposatha breeds, thoroughbred horses amongst Sindh breed, and thoroughbreds of cattle amongst Usabha breed. But the Buddha said nothing about thoroughbreds of people. 

                  So Ānanda decided to ask the Buddha. The Buddha told him that noble people are not born in any particular family. But wherever they are born, that family is very lucky indeed.

.. [DLMBSFn-V194] (DLMBS Commentary V194) Some monks were discussing what is the true happiness. Everybody defined the word in different way and so they realized that happiness could mean completely dissimilar things to different people. For some, money and fame were happiness, for some sensual pleasures, for some good food… 

                  They asked the Buddha what the true happiness really was. He replied them with this verse, saying that only these things constitute real happiness: arising of a Buddha in this world, opportunity to hear the Dharma, unity and harmony amongst monks.

.. [DLMBSFn-V195] (DLMBS Commentary V195) The Buddha was once on a journey with many monks, when they came to a field, which had a Brahmanic shrine nearby. A Brahmin was ploughing the field. Then the Brahmin came to the Buddha, but he paid his respects to the shrine, not to the Buddha. The Buddha praised him for this deed but then told him that there were people and objects more worthy of devotion. He made appear a golden stupa of Kassapa Buddha. He then explained that there were four classes of people worthy of a stupa. They are the Fully Awakened Buddhas, the Pacceka Buddhas (who are also awakened but lack the power to teach the Dharma), the disciples who have reached Awakenment and Universal Monarchs. The Buddha further revealed that there could be three types of stupas. The stupas with corporeal relics of such people inside, the figures and statues of them and the personal effects such as robes or bowls these people used. These people and objects are truly worthy of veneration. 

                  At the end of the discourse, the Brahmin attained the first stage of Awakenment. The golden stupa remained visible for seven days and many people came to pay their respects. After seven days the stupa disappeared and a stone stupa was erected in its place.

.. [DLMBSFn-V196] (DLMBS Commentary V196) The story for this verse is identical with the story for the previous one (DhP 195). 

                  It is important to pay respects to those who are most worthy of it. That means basically the Buddha and his followers. By paying our respects to them, we are able to gain the most merit. Paying respects to other people is also beneficial, but can never be as good as honoring the Buddha.
