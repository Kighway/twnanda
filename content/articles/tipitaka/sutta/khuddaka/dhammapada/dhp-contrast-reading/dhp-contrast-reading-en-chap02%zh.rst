**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

       | Was crowned as the sovereign deva.
       | Thus, heedfulness wins acclamation,
       | And slackness receives deprecation.

.. [NāradaFn02-01]  (Ven. Nārada 02-01) Appamàda, literally, means non-infatuation i.e., ever-present mindfulness, watchfulness or earnestness in doing good. The ethical essence of Buddhism may be summed up by this word - appamàda. The last words of the Buddha were - appamàdena sampàdetha - strive on with diligence.

.. [NāradaFn02-02]  (Ven. Nārada 02-02) Amata - Nibbàna, the ultimate goal of Buddhists. As this positive term clearly indicates, Nibbàna is not annihilation or a state of nothingness as some are apt to believe. It is the permanent, immortal, supramundane state which cannot be expressed by mundane terms.

.. [NāradaFn02-03]  (Ven. Nārada 02-03) This should not be understood to mean that they are immortal. No being is immortal, not even Buddhas or Arahants. The idea implied herein is that the heedful, who realize Nibbàna are not reborn, and so do not die. The heedless are regarded as dead because they are not intent on doing good, and are subject to repeated births and deaths.

.. [NāradaFn02-04]  (Ven. Nārada 02-04) Knowing well that there is emancipation for the heedful, but not for the heedless.

.. [NāradaFn02-05]  (Ven. Nārada 02-05) Here Ariyas mean the pure ones like the Buddhas and Arahants. The realm of the Ariyas means the thirty-seven factors of Enlightenment (Bodhipakkhiyadhamma) and the nine supramundane states. See notes on v.44 and v.115.

.. [NāradaFn02-06]  (Ven. Nārada 02-06) Here meditation includes both concentration (samatha) and contemplation or insight (vipassanà).

.. [NāradaFn02-07]  (Ven. Nārada 02-07) Yogakkhema - free from the four bonds of sense-desires (kàma), craving for existence (bhava), false views (diññhi), and ignorance (avijjà).

.. [NāradaFn02-08]  (Ven. Nārada 02-08) Nibbàna = ni + vàna, lit., departure from craving. It is a supramundane state that can be attained in this life itself. It is also explained as extinction of passions, but not a state of nothingness. It is an eternal blissful state of relief that results from the complete eradication of the passions.

                    Metaphysically Nibbàna is the extinction of suffering; psychologically it is the elimination of egoism; ethically it is the eradication of lust, hatred and ignorance.

.. [NāradaFn02-09]  (Ven. Nārada 02-09) An island situated on a higher level cannot be flooded although the surrounding low-lying land may be inundated. Such an island becomes a refuge to all. In the same way the wise man who develops insight should make an island of himself by attaining Arahantship so that he may not be drowned by the four floods of sense-desires (kàma) false beliefs (ditthi), craving for existence (bhava) and ignorance (avijjà).

.. [NāradaFn02-10]  (Ven. Nārada 02-10) The sorrowless Arahants look compassionately with their Divine Eye upon the ignorant folk, who, being subject to repeated births, are not free from sorrow.

.. [NāradaFn02-11]  (Ven. Nārada 02-11) Maghavà is synonymous with Sakka, king of the gods. The Maghamànavaka Jataka relates that in the remote past a public-spirited person who had spent his whole lifetime in welfare work with the cooperation of his friends, was born as Sakka as the result of his good actions.

.. [NāradaFn02-12]  (Ven. Nārada 02-12) Devas. lit., sporting or shining ones, are a class of beings with subtle physical bodies invisible to the naked eye. They live in the celestial planes. There are also earth-bound deities.

.. [NāradaFn02-13]  (Ven. Nārada 02-13) A fully ordained disciple of the Buddha is called a Bhikkhu. "Mendicant monk" may be suggested as the closest equivalent for "Bhikkhu". He is not a priest as he is no mediator between God and man. He has no vows for life but he is bound by his rules which he takes of his own accord. He leads a life of voluntary poverty and celibacy. If he is unable to live the Holy Life, he can discard the robe at any time.

.. [NāradaFn02-14]  (Ven. Nārada 02-14) Sa§yojana - lit., that which yokes beings to the ocean of life. There are ten kinds of fetters- namely: self-illusion (sakkàyadiññhi), doubts (vicikicchà), indulgence in (wrongful) rites and ceremonies (sãlabbataparàmàsa), sense-desires (kàmaràga), hatred (pañigha), attachment to the Realms of Form (råparàga), attachment to the Formless Realms (aråparàga), conceit (màna), restlessness (uddhacca) and ignorance (avijjà).

                    The first five, pertaining to This Shore (orambhàgiya) are regarded as small, the rest, pertaining to the Further Shore (uddhambhàgiya) as great.

                    The first three are eradicated on attaining the first Stage of Sainthood (Sotàpatti).

                    The second two are attenuated on attaining the second stage of Sainthood (Sakadàgàmi).

                    The second two are destroyed on attaining the third stage of Sainthood (Anàgàmi).

                    The last five are eradicated on attaining the fourth stage of Sainthood (Arahatta).
                    
.. [NāradaFn02-15]  (Ven. Nārada 02-15) From his spiritual heights which he has attained.

.. [BudRkFn02-01]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 02-01) (v. 21) *The Deathless (amata)*: Nibbana, so called because those who attain it are free from the cycle of repeated birth and death.

.. [BudRkFn02-02]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 02-02) (v. 22) *The Noble Ones (ariya)*: those who have reached any of the four stages of supramundane attainment leading irreversibly to Nibbana.

.. [BudRkFn02-03]  *Indra*: the ruler of the gods in ancient Indian mythology.

.. [ThaniSFn-V21] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 21) The Deathless = Unbinding (nibbana/nirvana), which gives release from the cycle of death and rebirth.

.. [ThaniSFn-V22] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 22) "The range of the noble ones": Any of the four stages of Awakening, as well as the total Unbinding to which they lead. The four stages are: (1) stream-entry, at which one abandons the first three mental fetters tying one to the round of rebirth: self-identity views, uncertainty, and grasping at habits and practices; (2) once-returning, at which passion, aversion, and delusion are further weakened; (3) non-returning, at which sensual passion and irritation are abandoned; and (4) arahantship, at which the final five fetters are abandoned: passion for form, passion for formless phenomena, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. For other references to the "range of the noble ones," see `92-93 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.07.than.html#dhp-92>`_ and `179-180 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.14.than.html#dhp-179>`_.

.. [ThaniSFn-V23] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 23) `AN 4.10 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.010.than.html>`_ lists four yokes: the yoke of sensuality, the yoke of becoming, the yoke of views, and the yoke of ignorance. To gain rest from the first three yokes, one must discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, and the escape from that yoke. One will then not be obsessed with passion, delight, attraction, infatuation, thirst, fever, fascination, craving with regard to that yoke. To gain rest from the yoke of ignorance, one must discern, as it actually is present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, and the escape from the six sense media. One will then not be obsessed with not-knowing.
