**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn09-01] (Ven. Nārada 09-01) There should be no delay in doing good deeds. One must avail oneself of every opportunity to do good. Such good actions redound to one's eternal happiness. Every effort also should be made to control the mind as it is prone to evil. The impure mind rejoices in evil thoughts.

.. [NāradaFn09-02] (Ven. Nārada 09-02) Pāpa, evil, is that which defiles one's mind. It is that which leads to woeful states. "Sin", purely a Christian term is not a good English equivalent for pāpa. What is associated with the three immoral roots such as lust (rāga), anger (dosa), and delusion (moha) is evil. There are ten kinds of evil. They are killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct (which are committed by deed); lying, slandering, harsh speech, and frivolous talk (which are committed by word); and covetousness, ill-will, and false views (which are committed by mind).

.. [NāradaFn09-03] (Ven. Nārada 09-03) Puñña, merit is that which cleanses the mind. Kusala is another term for puñña. There are ten kinds of meritorious deeds. See notes on vv. 42, 43.

.. [NāradaFn09-04] (Ven. Nārada 09-04) A wicked person may lead a prosperous life as the result of his past good deeds. He will experience happiness owing to the potentiality of his past good over the present evil, a seeming injustice which often prevails in this world. When once, according to the inexorable law of kamma, his evil actions fructify, then he perceives the painful effects of his wickedness.

.. [NāradaFn09-05] (Ven. Nārada 09-05) A virtuous person, as often happens, may meet with adversity owing to the potentiality of his past evil actions over his present good acts. He is convinced of the efficacy of his present good deeds only when, at the opportune moment, they fructify, giving him abundant bliss. The fact that at times the wicked are prosperous and the virtuous are unfortunate is itself strong evidence in support of the belief in kamma and rebirth.

.. [NāradaFn09-06] (Ven. Nārada 09-06) Māppamaññetha in most texts.

.. [NāradaFn09-07] (Ven. Nārada 09-07) That is, for one who has no evil intention.

.. [NāradaFn09-08] (Ven. Nārada 09-08) According to Buddhism there are four kinds of birth - namely: egg-born (aṇóaja), womb-born (jalābuja), moisture-born (saṃsedaja) and spontaneous birth (opapātika).

.. [NāradaFn09-09] (Ven. Nārada 09-09) Niraya = ni + aya = devoid of happiness. There are four kinds of niraya - namely: woeful state (apāya), the animal kingdom (tiracchānayoni), the plane of Petas (petayoni) and the plane of Asura-demons (asurayoni).

                    None of these states is eternal. According to their evil kamma beings may be born in such woeful states. Departing from those states they may be born in blissful states according to their past good kamma.

.. [NāradaFn09-10] (Ven. Nārada 09-10) Sagga = su + agga = full of happiness. In the sense-sphere (kāmaloka) the human plane and the six celestial planes are regarded as blissful states. They too are not eternal.

.. [NāradaFn09-11] (Ven. Nārada 09-11) Arahants, after death, are not born any more, but attain Parinibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn09-12] (Ven. Nārada 09-12) The Buddhist law of moral causation cannot be bribed, nor can one escape the evil consequences of kamma by seeking refuge in any place on earth. No god, not even a Buddha, can intervene in the operation of kamma.

.. [ThaniSFn-V121-122] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 121-122) "('It won't amount to much')": reading na mattam agamissati with the Thai edition. Other editions read, na mantam agamissati, "It won't come to me."

.. [ThaniSFn-V126] (Ven. Thanissaro V.126) Heaven and hell, in the Buddhist view of the cosmos, are not eternal states. One may be reborn on one of the various levels of heaven or hell as the result of one's kamma on the human plane, and then leave that level when that particular store of kamma wears out.
