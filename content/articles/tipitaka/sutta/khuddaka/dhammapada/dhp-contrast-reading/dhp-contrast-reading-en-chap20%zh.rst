.. [NāradaFn20-01] (Ven. Nārada 20-01) The Eightfold Path is the Middle Way discovered by the Buddha for the realization of Nibbāna. It consists of: right understanding(sammā diññhi), right thoughts (sammā saṅkappa), right speech (sammā vācā), right action (sammā kammanta), right livelihood (sammā ājīva), right effort (sammā vāyāma), right mindfulness (sammā sati), and right concentration (sammā samādhi).

                    This is the unique path of Enlightenment. From a philosophical stand-point these eight factors are the eight mental states found in the supramundane consciousness which has Nibbāna for its object.

.. [NāradaFn20-02] (Ven. Nārada 20-02) They are the four Noble Truths - suffering, the cause of suffering, the destruction of suffering, and the path leading to the destruction of suffering. The first truth of suffering is to be comprehended, the cause of suffering (which is craving) is to be eradicated, the destruction of suffering (which is Nibbāna) is to be realized, the path leading to the destruction of suffering (which is the Eightfold Path) is to be developed. Whether the Buddhas arise or not these four truths exist in the world. It is the Buddhas that reveal them to mankind.

.. [NāradaFn20-03] (Ven. Nārada 20-03) Virāga = Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn20-04] (Ven. Nārada 20-04) Of lust etc.

.. [NāradaFn20-05] (Ven. Nārada 20-05) That is, to control passions in order to realize Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn20-06] (Ven. Nārada 20-06) When the Buddha refers to Himself He employs the term Tathāgata which means "who thus hath come".

.. [NāradaFn20-07] (Ven. Nārada 20-07) Saṅkhāra is a multisignificant term. Here it is used in the sense of things conditioned by causes. Supermundane Nibbāna is not included in saṅkhāra as it is not conditioned by any cause. It is causeless and timeless.

.. [NāradaFn20-08] (Ven. Nārada 20-08) Suffering caused by attending to the five Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn20-09] (Ven. Nārada 20-09) Impermanence (anicca), sorrow (dukkha) and no-soul (anatta) are the three characteristics of all things conditioned by causes. It is by contemplating them that one realizes Nibbāna. The aspirant may choose any characteristic that appeals to him most.

                     Anattā or no-soul is the crux of Buddhism. The term saṅkhāra which is applied to any conditioned thing is used in the two previous verses, while in the third verse the term dhamma is used. The commentator interprets dhamma as the "aggregates" (khandhā). The same interpretation he gives to saṅkhāra too. If by dhamma is meant saṅkhāra, there is no reason for the Buddha to make a differentiation in the third verse.

                     Saṅkhāra is applied only to those things conditioned by causes. Dhamma can be applied to both conditioned and unconditioned things and states. It embraces both conditioned and unconditioned things including Nibbāna. In order to show that even Nibbāna is free from a permanent soul the Buddha used the term dhamma in the third verse. Nibbāna is a positive supramundane state and is without a soul.

                     "All the elements of being are non-self. When one by wisdom realizes (this), he heeds not (is superior to) (this world of) sorrow, this is the path to purity". Radhakrishnan.

.. [NāradaFn20-10] (Ven. Nārada 20-10) Saṃsannasaṅkappamano literally, mind with right thoughts depressed.

.. [NāradaFn20-11] (Ven. Nārada 20-11) Here vana means forest of such passions as lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn20-12] (Ven. Nārada 20-12) When the Buddha said, "Cut down the forest", some newly ordained monks erroneously gave the expression its literal meaning. The Buddha, reading their thoughts, corrected them, stating that what he meant was not actual trees but passions.

.. [NāradaFn20-13] (Ven. Nārada 20-13) Vana means big trees and vanatha means smaller trees. Here vana means the powerful passions and vanatha means the lesser passions.

.. [NāradaFn20-14] (Ven. Nārada 20-14) Having eradicated all passions by means of the four Paths, be passionless.

.. [BudRkFn-v283] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 283) The meaning of this injunction is: "Cut down the forest of lust, but do not mortify the body."

.. [ThaniSFn-V273] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 273) The four truths: stress, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation (which is identical to the eightfold path). See note 191.

.. [ThaniSFn-V275] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 275) "I have taught you this path": reading akkhato vo maya maggo with the Thai edition, a reading supported by the Patna Dhp. "Having known — for your knowing": two ways of interpreting what is apparently a play on the Pali word, aññaya, which can be either be the gerund of ajanati or the dative of añña. On the extraction of arrows as a metaphor for the practice, see MN 63 and MN 105.

.. [ThaniSFn-V285] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 285) Although the first word in this verse, ucchinda, literally means "crush," "destroy," "annihilate," I have found no previous English translation that renders it accordingly. Most translate it as "cut out" or "uproot," which weakens the image. On the role played by self-allure in leading the heart to become fixated on others, see AN 7.48.

.. [ThaniSFn-V288] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 288) Ender = death.

.. [VaradoFn-V275] (Ven. Varado V.275) Verse 275: The sting of the arrow I’ve known/ And, to you, the appeasement (santhanaṃ) I’ve shown. PED (santhana): appeasing.  

.. [VaradoFn-V285] (Ven. Varado V.285) Verse 285: "crush (ucchinda) an exquisite carnation". PED (ucchindati): destroy.

.. [DLMBSFn-V273] (DLMBS Commentary V273) Once the Buddha with a group of monks returned to the Jetavana monastery after a teaching trip. In the evening, some monks talked about the trip, about the condition of the path, about the nature of the land, whether it was hilly or flat etc. 

    The Buddha entered the hall where they were talking and told them this verse (and the following ones, DhP 274, DhP 275 and DhP 276), saying that such talks were ultimately meaningless.

.. [DLMBSFn-V274] (DLMBS Commentary V274) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 273) and the following ones (DhP 275 and DhP 276). 
    The Eightfold path is said to be the only way to reach the Awakenment. It means, we have to follow all the eight constituents of the Path in order to be able to purify the mind and attain the Nirvana. What are the eight constituents of the Eightfold path? They are Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration.

.. [DLMBSFn-V275] (DLMBS Commentary V275) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 273, DhP 274) and the following one (DhP 276). 

    The Buddha taught the teaching that he personally discovered. He taught from his own experience. He found out how to "remove the arrow", or how to end the suffering. He then proclaimed this path for everyone to follow. By doing so, we are able to do what the Buddha did - to put an end to suffering forever.

.. [DLMBSFn-V276] (DLMBS Commentary V276) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verses (DhP 273, DhP 274 and DhP 275). 

    The Buddha found the way to make an end to suffering. He taught it to us. But we have to make the effort. Nobody will do it for us. We cannot wait for a teacher to pull us from the swamp by some miracle. Only by diligent meditation and daily practice can we be released from the bond of Mara, from the world of suffering.

.. [DLMBSFn-V277] (DLMBS Commentary V277) Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive the impermanence of things. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on its meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V278] (DLMBS Commentary V278) Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive the unsatisfactoriness of conditioned things. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on its meaning

.. [DLMBSFn-V279] (DLMBS Commentary V279) Once a group of monks obtained a subject of meditation from the Buddha. They went to the forest and practiced meditation. However, they made a little progress. Therefore they returned to the Buddha and asked him for another subject of meditation. The Buddha reflected that due to their past lives they were ready to perceive that all things are without a self. He told them this verse and advised them to meditate on its meaning.

.. [DLMBSFn-V280] (DLMBS Commentary V280) A group of young men became monks. They all received a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to the forest to practice meditation. But one of them, named Tissa, stayed behind in the monastery and did not meditate diligently. 

    The monks who practiced meditation all attained Awakenment and came back to the monastery to pay their respects to the Buddha. When Tissa saw that all of his friends were now Arahants, he regretted that he wasted his time. He decided to try very hard and started to meditate throughout the night. While he was practicing walking meditation he slipped and broke his leg. When the Buddha heard about this he spoke this verse, saying that we should exert while we can.

.. [DLMBSFn-V281] (DLMBS Commentary V281) Venerable Moggallāna once went on an alms-round with Venerable Lakkhana. Suddenly Moggallāna smiled, because he saw a hungry ghost (*peta*) with the head of a pig and a human body. Later Lakkhana asked Moggallāna why he smiled. Moggallāna told him about the *peta*.

    The Buddha overheard that and told them that he himself saw the same *peta*. He then related the *peta*'s story. Once he was a famous monk who was very good at expounding the Dharma. Once he came to a monastery, where two friend monks stayed. After a while he realized that he liked the place very much. There was plenty of good food and the lay followers liked his way of expounding the Dharma. So he decided to make the two monks go away and keep the place just for himself. He set one friend against the other. They quarreled and left away. 

    Because of this the monk suffered for a long time. He had to be born as a hungry ghost. The Buddha finished his story by this verse, saying that we should always guard our actions bodily, verbal and mental.

.. [DLMBSFn-V282] (DLMBS Commentary V282) There was a monk name Pothila. He knew the Dharma very well and taught it to many followers. But he did not practice meditation and was conceited. The Buddha wanted to put him on the right path and therefore called him "useless Pothila". Pothila reflected on those words and realized what did the Buddha mean. So he went to the senior monk and humbly asked to be his pupil. But the monk sent him to the next senior monk. This happened several times until Pothila ended up as a pupil of a young novice (who was an Arahant). 

    He followed the meditation instructions diligently and was no longer conceited because of his theoretical mastery of the Dharma. The Buddha saw his effort and told him this verse. Soon after, Pothila reached the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V283] (DLMBS Commentary V283) In the city of Sāvatthi there lived five friends. When they became old, they all went forth and became monks. But they had the habit of going to their old homes for almsfood. Especially a former wife of one of them was a very good cook. So they went to her house often and she looked after them. But one day, this old lady fell sick and died. The five friends wept and lamented, praising her virtues. 

    The Buddha overheard this and told them this verse (and the following one, DhP 284), saying that sorrow comes from ignorance, greed and hatred. Especially in this case, greed was the main factor. So he taught them to cut off "the forest" of greed and passions in order to be free from sorrow.

.. [DLMBSFn-V284] (DLMBS Commentary V284) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 283). 

    Greed or passion is one of the three main roots of evil. Due to the underlying ignorance, we feel passion and hatred, like and dislike. Because of that we do things with the mind bound with passion or hatred. Therefore we create karma that keeps us in the circle of life and death. Only when we cut off these passions and dissolve ignorance, can we stop creating karmically good and bad deeds and be free from suffering, with a free mind.

.. [DLMBSFn-V285] (DLMBS Commentary V285) Venerable Sāriputta had a young monk as a pupil. This monk was a son of a goldsmith. Sāriputta gave him a subject of meditation (impurity of the body) and the monk went to the forest to practice meditation. But he did not make any progress and kept returning to Sāriputta to ask for more instructions. So Sāriputta took him to see the Buddha. 

    The Buddha changed the tactics. He gave the monk a beautiful lotus. He told him to put it in front of himself and meditate on its purity and beauty. The monk did so and was able to reach unbroken concentration and achieve the fourth level of mental absorption (**jhāna**). 

    At that moment the Buddha made the lotus to wither. The monk saw this and 
    realized the impermanence of all things. The Buddha then further exhorted him with this verse. The monk reflected on its meaning and attained the Awakenment.

.. [DLMBSFn-V286] (DLMBS Commentary V286) Mahādhana was a merchant from Benares. Once he came to Sāvatthi during a festival, hoping to sell his goods. But on the way he was stopped by a flood and could not cross the river for seven days. Thus the festival ended before he even got there. 

    Mahādhana decided to stay in Sāvatthi for some time and sell his goods slowly. Once the Buddha saw him and smiled. Ānanda asked him about the reason for his smile. The Buddha replied that Mahādhana is not aware of his impeding death and thinks he can stay in Sāvatthi comfortably, sell his goods and then return home. 

    Ānanda then advised Mahādhana to listen to the Buddha's sermons and to practice mindfulness. Mahādhana was alarmed when he heard that he was about to die. For seven days he gave alms to the Buddha and monks and listened to the Dharma. After hearing this verse from the Buddha, he attained the first stage of Awakenment. After he died he was reborn in the Tusita heaven.

.. [DLMBSFn-V287] (DLMBS Commentary V287) Kisā Gotami came to see the Buddha after her only son died. The Buddha told her this verse in order to calm her down. See DhP 114 for the whole story.

.. [DLMBSFn-V288] (DLMBS Commentary V288) Paṭācārā lost her husband, two sons, parents and the only brother almost at the same time. She grieved so much that she went almost crazy. When she came to see the Buddha, he told her this verse (and the following one, DhP 289) to calm her down. For the whole story see DhP 113.

.. [DLMBSFn-V289] (DLMBS Commentary V289) The story for this verse is identical with the one for the previous verse (DhP 288). 

    The only help and protection against the death is constant and intensive practice of the Buddha’s teaching. No external help from relatives, friends or gods of any kind is possible when we have to face the death. Only by following the path of meditation and awareness, can we overcome death and face it without any fear.
