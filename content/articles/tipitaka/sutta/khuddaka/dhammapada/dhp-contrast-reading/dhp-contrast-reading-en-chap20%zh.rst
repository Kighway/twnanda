**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

        THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE EAST, VOLUME X PART I. THE DHAMMAPADA; TRANSLATED BY VARIOUS ORIENTAL SCHOLARS AND EDITED BY F. MAX MüLLER, OXFOKD UNIVERSITY FBESS WABEHOUSE, 1881; `PDF <http://sourceoflightmonastery.tripod.com/webonmediacontents/1373032.pdf>`__ ( from: http://sourceoflightmonastery.tripod.com)

.. [NāradaFn20-01] (Ven. Nārada 20-01) The Eightfold Path is the Middle Way discovered by the Buddha for the realization of Nibbāna. It consists of: right understanding(sammā diññhi), right thoughts (sammā saṅkappa), right speech (sammā vācā), right action (sammā kammanta), right livelihood (sammā ājīva), right effort (sammā vāyāma), right mindfulness (sammā sati), and right concentration (sammā samādhi).

                    This is the unique path of Enlightenment. From a philosophical stand-point these eight factors are the eight mental states found in the supramundane consciousness which has Nibbāna for its object.

.. [NāradaFn20-02] (Ven. Nārada 20-02) They are the four Noble Truths - suffering, the cause of suffering, the destruction of suffering, and the path leading to the destruction of suffering. The first truth of suffering is to be comprehended, the cause of suffering (which is craving) is to be eradicated, the destruction of suffering (which is Nibbāna) is to be realized, the path leading to the destruction of suffering (which is the Eightfold Path) is to be developed. Whether the Buddhas arise or not these four truths exist in the world. It is the Buddhas that reveal them to mankind.

.. [NāradaFn20-03] (Ven. Nārada 20-03) Virāga = Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn20-04] (Ven. Nārada 20-04) Of lust etc.

.. [NāradaFn20-05] (Ven. Nārada 20-05) That is, to control passions in order to realize Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn20-06] (Ven. Nārada 20-06) When the Buddha refers to Himself He employs the term Tathāgata which means "who thus hath come".

.. [NāradaFn20-07] (Ven. Nārada 20-07) Saṅkhāra is a multisignificant term. Here it is used in the sense of things conditioned by causes. Supermundane Nibbāna is not included in saṅkhāra as it is not conditioned by any cause. It is causeless and timeless.

.. [NāradaFn20-08] (Ven. Nārada 20-08) Suffering caused by attending to the five Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn20-09] (Ven. Nārada 20-09) Impermanence (anicca), sorrow (dukkha) and no-soul (anatta) are the three characteristics of all things conditioned by causes. It is by contemplating them that one realizes Nibbāna. The aspirant may choose any characteristic that appeals to him most.

                     Anattā or no-soul is the crux of Buddhism. The term saṅkhāra which is applied to any conditioned thing is used in the two previous verses, while in the third verse the term dhamma is used. The commentator interprets dhamma as the "aggregates" (khandhā). The same interpretation he gives to saṅkhāra too. If by dhamma is meant saṅkhāra, there is no reason for the Buddha to make a differentiation in the third verse.

                     Saṅkhāra is applied only to those things conditioned by causes. Dhamma can be applied to both conditioned and unconditioned things and states. It embraces both conditioned and unconditioned things including Nibbāna. In order to show that even Nibbāna is free from a permanent soul the Buddha used the term dhamma in the third verse. Nibbāna is a positive supramundane state and is without a soul.

                     "All the elements of being are non-self. When one by wisdom realizes (this), he heeds not (is superior to) (this world of) sorrow, this is the path to purity". Radhakrishnan.

.. [NāradaFn20-10] (Ven. Nārada 20-10) Saṃsannasaṅkappamano literally, mind with right thoughts depressed.

.. [NāradaFn20-11] (Ven. Nārada 20-11) Here vana means forest of such passions as lust, hatred, and delusion.

.. [NāradaFn20-12] (Ven. Nārada 20-12) When the Buddha said, "Cut down the forest", some newly ordained monks erroneously gave the expression its literal meaning. The Buddha, reading their thoughts, corrected them, stating that what he meant was not actual trees but passions.

.. [NāradaFn20-13] (Ven. Nārada 20-13) Vana means big trees and vanatha means smaller trees. Here vana means the powerful passions and vanatha means the lesser passions.

.. [NāradaFn20-14] (Ven. Nārada 20-14) Having eradicated all passions by means of the four Paths, be passionless.

.. [BudRkFn-v283] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 283) The meaning of this injunction is: "Cut down the forest of lust, but do not mortify the body."

.. [ThaniSFn-V273] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 273) The four truths: stress, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation (which is identical to the eightfold path). See note 191.

.. [ThaniSFn-V275] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 275) "I have taught you this path": reading akkhato vo maya maggo with the Thai edition, a reading supported by the Patna Dhp. "Having known — for your knowing": two ways of interpreting what is apparently a play on the Pali word, aññaya, which can be either be the gerund of ajanati or the dative of añña. On the extraction of arrows as a metaphor for the practice, see MN 63 and MN 105.

.. [ThaniSFn-V285] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 285) Although the first word in this verse, ucchinda, literally means "crush," "destroy," "annihilate," I have found no previous English translation that renders it accordingly. Most translate it as "cut out" or "uproot," which weakens the image. On the role played by self-allure in leading the heart to become fixated on others, see AN 7.48.

.. [ThaniSFn-V288] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 288) Ender = death.

.. [VaradoFn-V275] (Ven. Varado V.275) Verse 275: The sting of the arrow I’ve known/ And, to you, the appeasement (santhanaṃ) I’ve shown. PED (santhana): appeasing.  

.. [VaradoFn-V285] (Ven. Varado V.285) Verse 285: "crush (ucchinda) an exquisite carnation". PED (ucchindati): destroy.
