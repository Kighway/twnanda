**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn25-01] (Ven. Nārada 25-01) Bhikkhu is exclusively a Buddhist term. "Mendicant monk" may be suggested as the best English equivalent.

.. [NāradaFn25-02] (Ven. Nārada 25-02) That is, in all senses, literally, everywhere.

.. [NāradaFn25-03] (Ven. Nārada 25-03) Here the Pali term ajjhatta, literally, personal, refers to the subject of meditation.

.. [NāradaFn25-04] (Ven. Nārada 25-04) Manta here means wisdom.

.. [NāradaFn25-05] (Ven. Nārada 25-05) Samādhi, both mundane and supramundane concentration.

.. [NāradaFn25-06] (Ven. Nārada 25-06) Having developed the third and fourth jhānas (ecstasies) with mettā (loving-kindness) as the object of meditation.

.. [NāradaFn25-07] (Ven. Nārada 25-07) That is, Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn25-08] (Ven. Nārada 25-08) The boat resembles the body, water resembles bad thoughts.

.. [NāradaFn25-09] (Ven. Nārada 25-09) They are the five fetters (orambhāgiya saṃyojana) that pertain to this shore - namely: self-illusion (sakkāyadiññhi), doubt (vicikicchā), indulgence in (wrongful) rites and ceremonies (sīlabbataparāmāsa), sense-desire (kāmarāga), and hatred (pañigha).

.. [NāradaFn25-10] (Ven. Nārada 25-10) They are the five fetters that pertain to the Farther Shore (uddhambhāgiyasaṃyojana), namely: attachment to the Realms of Form (rūparāga), attachment to the Formless Realms (arūparāga), conceit (māna), restlessness (uddhacca), and ignorance (avijjā).

.. [NāradaFn25-11] (Ven. Nārada 25-11) Namely: confidence (saddhā), mindfulness (sati), effort (viriya), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (pa¤¤ā). These five factors have to be cultivated if one desires to destroy the fetters.

.. [NāradaFn25-12] (Ven. Nārada 25-12) See note under v. 342.

.. [NāradaFn25-13] (Ven. Nārada 25-13) Amānusī ratī = the eight Attainments (aññhasamāpatti), the four Rūpa Jhānas and the four Arūpa Jhānas.

.. [NāradaFn25-14] (Ven. Nārada 25-14) As it leads to Nibbāna.

.. [NāradaFn25-15] (Ven. Nārada 25-15) Pātimokkha which deals with the rules that a bhikkhu is bound to observe.

.. [NāradaFn25-16] (Ven. Nārada 25-16) Pañimaṃsetha attanā in some books

.. [BudRkFn-v370] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 370) The five to be cut off are the five "lower fetters": self-illusion, doubt, belief in rites and rituals, lust and ill-will. The five to be abandoned are the five "higher fetters": craving for the divine realms with form, craving for the formless realms, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. Stream-enterers and once-returners cut off the first three fetters, non-returners the next two and Arahants the last five. The five to be cultivated are the five spiritual faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The five bonds are: greed, hatred, delusion, false views, and conceit.

Thanissaro V. 370) DhpA: Cut through five = the five lower fetters that tie the mind to the round of rebirth (self-identity views, uncertainty, grasping at habits & practices, sensual passion, irritation); let go of five = the five higher fetters (passion for form, passion for formless phenomena, conceit, restlessness, ignorance); develop five = the five faculties (conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, discernment); five attachments = passion, aversion, delusion, conceit, views.
