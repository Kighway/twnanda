     - THERE IS NO EVIL THAT A LIAR CANNOT COMMIT

       176. There is no evil that cannot be done by the liar, [NāradaFn13-12]_ who has transgressed the one law (of truthfulness) and who is indifferent to a world beyond.

       |  They who, in speaking, are guilty of falsity, 
       |  Flouting one virtue, the virtue of honesty -

   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_
     - 176 If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies, and scoffs at another world, there is no evil he will not do.

**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [NāradaFn13-01] (Ven. Nārada 13-01) That is, sensual pleasures.

.. [NāradaFn13-02] (Ven. Nārada 13-02) By being subject to repeated births and deaths.

.. [NāradaFn13-03] (Ven. Nārada 13-03) This translation is according to the Commentary but owing to the ambiguity of the first word it may be translated, "be alert, be not heedless", etc.

.. [NāradaFn13-04] (Ven. Nārada 13-04) This psycho-physical organism is to be regarded as being as empty as a bubble and as illusive as a mirage. The wise man who could so regard it would end the ills of life.

.. [NāradaFn13-05] (Ven. Nārada 13-05) This body, composed of the five Aggregates.

.. [NāradaFn13-06] (Ven. Nārada 13-06) By the Path of Arahantship.

.. [NāradaFn13-07] (Ven. Nārada 13-07) One has to reap the effects of one's Kamma. But one is not bound to reap the effects of all actions one has done in the course of Saṃsāra. If one were, an escape from birth and death would be impossible. At times it is possible to obliterate one's evil kamma by performing powerful good kamma.

.. [NāradaFn13-08] (Ven. Nārada 13-08) Sagga - blissful states, not eternal heavens.

.. [NāradaFn13-09] (Ven. Nārada 13-09) Iddhi. By mental development it is possible to fly through the air, walk on water, dive into the earth, etc. Such kinds of powers are psychic and supernormal, but not miraculous.

.. [NāradaFn13-10] (Ven. Nārada 13-10) That is, the Arahants attain Parinibbāna without coming into birth again.

.. [NāradaFn13-11] (Ven. Nārada 13-11) The host of Māra, the Evil One, is described as comprising ten kinds of passions (kilesa). They are: 1. material pleasures (kāma), 2. aversion for the Holy Life (arati), 3. hunger and thirst (khuppipāsā), 4. craving (taṇhā), 5. sloth and torpor (thīna-middha), 6. fear (bhaya), 7. doubt (vicikicchā), 8. detraction and obstinacy (makkha-thambha), 9. gain (lābha), praise (siloka) honour (sakkāra) and ill-gotten fame (yasa), 10. Extolling of oneself and contempt for others (attukkaṃsana-paravambhana).

.. [NāradaFn13-12] (Ven. Nārada 13-12) An untruthful person, devoid of self-respect, who has no belief in an after life and who has no fear for the attendant consequences of evil, is liable to commit any evil. Such a person does not see earthly bliss or heavenly bliss or Nibbānic bliss (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn13-13] (Ven. Nārada 13-13) Internal purification is far superior to fleeting worldly possessions of transitory heavenly bliss.

.. [NāradaFn13-14] (Ven. Nārada 13-14) Sotāpatti. Here Sota means the stream that leads to Nibbāna. It is the noble Eightfold Path. "Ā" means for the first time. "Patti" means attainment. Sotāpatti means the attainment of the stream for the first time. It is the realization of Nibbāna for the first time. This is the first stage of Sainthood. The Stream-Winners are not born in woeful states, but the worldly great are not exempt from them.

.. [BudRkFn-v178]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 178) Stream-entry (sotapatti): the first stage of supramundane attainment.

.. [ThaniSFn-V170] (Ven. Thanissaro V.170) The Sutta Nipata (Sn 5.15) reports a conversation between the Buddha and the brahman Mogharaja with a point similar to that of this verse:
                    ::

                     Mogharaja:
                     In what way does one view the world
                     so as not to be seen
                       by Death's king?

                     The Buddha:
                     View the world, Mogharaja,
                          as empty —
                     always mindful
                     to have removed any view
                          about self.
                     This way one is above & beyond death.
                     This is the way one views the world
                     so as not to be seen
                       by Death's king.

.. [ThaniSFn-V176] (Ven. Thanissaro V.176) This verse is also found at Iti.25, where the context makes clear the meaning of ekam dhammam, or "this one thing": the principle of truthfulness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V178] (Ven. Thanissaro V.178) The fruit of stream-entry is the first of the four stages of Awakening (see note 22). A person who has attained stream entry — entry into the stream that flows inevitably to Unbinding — is destined to attain full Awakening within at most seven lifetimes, never falling below the human state in the interim.
