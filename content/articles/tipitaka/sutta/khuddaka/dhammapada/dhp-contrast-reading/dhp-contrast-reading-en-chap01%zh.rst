**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

     - Chapter 1 The Twin Verses (Yamaka [NāradaFn01-01]_  Vagga)
        EVIL BEGETS EVIL
         1. Mind is the forerunner of (all evil) states.  [NāradaFn01-02]_ Mind is chief; mind-made are they. If one speaks or acts with wicked mind, because of that, suffering follows one, even as the wheel follows the hoof of the draught-ox.

        |            ruled by the heart,

        | If you speak or act
        | with a corrupted heart,
        | then suffering follows you —
        | as the wheel of the cart,

   * - Translated from the Pali by **Ven. Varado Bhikkhu** [6]_
     - **  1. Twinned Verses** 
        | **1**  Mind precedes created things;
        | Mind’s their chief, from mind they spring.
        | With tainted mind who speaks or acts,
        | Pain trails that man like the wheel trails ox-tracks.
     
   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_
     - Chapter I: The Twin-Verses
        1 All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage.

       |   his mind well-released,
       |      not clinging
       |   either here or hereafter:
       | he has his share in the contemplative life.

   * - Translated from the Pali by **Ven. Varado Bhikkhu** [6]_
     - | **20** Although a person infrequently recites the scriptures 
       |           if he practises in accordance with Dhamma; 
       |           if he has abandoned greed, hatred and delusion; 
       |           if he possesses right knowledge; 
       |           if his mind is liberated;
       |           if he is attached to nothing in the human or deva realms,
       | he has a real share in the life of asceticism.
     
   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_
     - 20 The follower of the law, even if he can recite only a small portion (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and hatred and foolishness, possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind, he, caring for nothing in this world or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.

.. [7] (note 007) original: `The Dhammapada <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dhammapada_(Muller)>`__ : A Collection of Verses: Being One of the Canonical Books of the Buddhists, translated by Friedrich Max Müller (en.wikisource.org) (revised Jack Maguire, SkyLight Pubns, Woodstock, Vermont, 2002)

.. [NāradaFn01-01]  (Ven. Nārada 01-01) Yamaka means a pair. This chapter is so named because it consists of ten pairs of parallel verses.

.. [NāradaFn01-02]  (Ven. Nārada 01-02) "Things are forerun by mind" - Mrs. Rhys Davids. "(The mental) natures are the result of what we have thought" - Radhakrishnan. "All that we are is the result of what we have thought" - Irving Babbit.

.. [NāradaFn01-03]  (Ven. Nārada 01-03) These two parallel verses were uttered by the Buddha on two different occasions to show the inevitable effects of evil and good Kamma respectively.

                    Man reaps what he has sown in the past or in the present. What he sows now he reaps in the present or in the future at the opportune moment. Man himself is mainly responsible for his own happiness and misery. He creates his own hell and heaven. He is the architect of his own fate. What he makes he can unmake.

                    Buddhism teaches self-responsibility and the inevitability of the law of cause and effect. What one reaps accords with what one has sown but one is not bound to reap the effects of all that one has sown. If one were, emancipation would become an impossibility.

.. [NāradaFn01-04]  (Ven. Nārada 01-04) The Buddha's constant advice to His followers is not to retaliate but to practise patience at all times, at all places, even under provocation. The Buddha extols those who bear and forbear the wrongs of others though they have the power to retaliate. In the Dhammapada itself there are many instances to show how the Buddha practised patience even when He was severely criticised, abused, and attacked. Patience is not a sign of weakness or defeatism but the unfailing strength of great men and women.

.. [NāradaFn01-05]  (Ven. Nārada 01-05) Avera, literally, means non-anger. Here it means the virtue opposed to the vice of anger, that is, loving-kindness (Mettà).

.. [NāradaFn01-06]  (Ven. Nārada 01-06) Sanantana an ancient principle followed by the Buddha and His disciples. (Commentary).

.. [NāradaFn01-07]  (Ven. Nārada 01-07) The quarrelsome persons.

.. [NāradaFn01-08]  (Ven. Nārada 01-08) Yamàmase; derived from yam, to perish, or to restrain.

.. [NāradaFn01-09]  (Ven. Nārada 01-09) The first line may also be rendered thus: Others do not know that here we must restrain ourselves. "The world does not know that we must all come to an end here" - Max Muller, "People do not discern that here we straitened are in life, in time" - Mrs. Rhys Davids.

.. [NāradaFn01-10]  (Ven. Nārada 01-10) Desiring pleasurable sensual objects.

.. [NāradaFn01-11]  (Ven. Nārada 01-11) According to Buddhism there are five kinds of Màras - namely: i. the five Aggregates (khandha), ii. moral and immoral activities (abhisaïkhàra), iii. death (maccu), iv. passions (kilesa), and v. Màra the deity (devaputta). Here the term Màra is used in the sense of passions.

.. [NāradaFn01-12]  (Ven. Nārada 01-12) The thirty-two impurities of the body such as hair, hair of the skin, nails, teeth, skin, etc. To overcome lust, meditation on the impurities of the body is recommended.

.. [NāradaFn01-13]  (Ven. Nārada 01-13) Saddhà is faith in the Buddha (the Teacher), the Dhamma (the Teaching) and the Sangha (the Order), based on knowledge. There is no blind faith in Buddhism. One is not expected to accept anything on mere unreasoning faith.

.. [NāradaFn01-14]  (Ven. Nārada 01-14) These two verses are meant exclusively for Bhikkhus who lead the Holy Life. The first verse indicates the worldly path of sense-gratification; the second, the spiritual path of sense-control and asceticism. It should be noted that Buddhism offers one way of life to the monks and another to the laity.

.. [NāradaFn01-15]  (Ven. Nārada 01-15) Kasàva means stains of passion. Kàsàva means a dyed robe, the outward symbol of renunciation. Robes of monks are dyed to make them valueless. Here is a play on words. External mark of the Holy Life is of no consequence without internal purity. On another occasion the Buddha remarked that a pure person is indeed an ideal recluse or Bhikkhu, irrespective of his external apparel. See v. 142.

.. [NāradaFn01-16]  (Ven. Nārada 01-16) Sàra means the core or essence. Asàra are the unessentials like the necessaries of life, false beliefs, etc. Sàra are the essentials like right beliefs, (sammà diññhi) morality (sãla), concentration (samàdhi), wisdom (pa¤¤à), etc. The essence of the Holy Life cannot be achieved by caring for unessentials.

                    In the Mahà Sàropama Sutta (Majjhima Nikàya, No. 29) the Buddha has compared the leaves and branches of a tree to gain and fame, the bark to morality, the greenwood to concentration, the fruits to the five kinds of super-intellect (abhi¤¤à) and the core to Arahantship.

.. [NāradaFn01-17]  (Ven. Nārada 01-17) Such as lust (kàma), illwill (vyàpàda), and harmfulness (vihi§sà)

.. [NāradaFn01-18]  (Ven. Nārada 01-18) Such as renunciation or non-attachment (nekkhamma), loving-kindness (avyàpàda), and harmlessness (avihi§sà). These pure thoughts constitute the second factor of the Noble Eightfold Path.

.. [NāradaFn01-19]  (Ven. Nārada 01-19) Bhàvita§, lit., made to become, i.e., trained, cultivated, developed. Mind is trained by concentration, which leads to one-pointedness of the mind and mental purification, and by contemplation, which leads to the understanding of things as they truly are. The ultimate goal of a Buddhist is achieved by these two stages of mental development. As physical exercise is to the body, so is meditation to the mind. A well-developed mind is not easily dominated by passions.

.. [NāradaFn01-20]  (Ven. Nārada 01-20) Repenting over his evil deeds, he suffers mentally.

.. [NāradaFn01-21]  (Ven. Nārada 01-21) Experiencing the effects of his evil deeds.

.. [NāradaFn01-22]  (Ven. Nārada 01-22) Reflecting on his good action.

.. [NāradaFn01-23]  (Ven. Nārada 01-23) Reaping the desirable results of his good deeds.

.. [NāradaFn01-24]  (Ven. Nārada 01-24) According to Buddhism the subsequent birth is determined by the thought process at the moment of death. Buddhists do not believe that the earth is the only habitable plane and that human beings are the only beings. Planes are numerous and beings are innumerable. After death one may be born as a human being or in a subhuman state or in a celestial plane according to one's actions. The so-called being in the subsequent life is neither the same as its predecessor (as it has changed) nor absolutely different (as it is the identical stream of life). Buddhism denies an identical being but affirms an identity in process.

.. [NāradaFn01-25]  (Ven. Nārada 01-25) Duggati is a woeful state and Sugati is a blissful state. Rebirths in all such states are temporary.

.. [NāradaFn01-26]  (Ven. Nārada 01-26) Sahita§ = saha + hita§, is that which is associated with what is beneficial. Commentary states that sahita§ is a synonym for the Tipiñaka, the three Baskets, taught by the Buddha, namely: Vinaya Piñaka, the Basket of Discipline, Sutta Piñaka, the Basket of Discourses, and Abhidhamma Piñaka, the Basket of Ultimate Doctrine.

.. [NāradaFn01-27]  (Ven. Nārada 01-27) The blessings of a monk are the four stages of Sainthood - namely: Sotàpatti, Stream Winner, Sakadàgàmi, Once-Returner, Anàgàmi, Never-Returner, and Arahanta, the Worthy.

.. [NāradaFn01-28]  (Ven. Nārada 01-28) Sàma¤¤assa = lit. the state of a monk or ascetic, i.e., the Holy life. According to Buddhism learning is of no avail without actual practice.

                    As such Buddhism is not a mere philosophy, but a unique Path of Enlightenment.

.. [BudRkFn01-01]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 01-01) (v. 7) Mara: the Tempter in Buddhism, represented in the scriptures as an evil-minded deity who tries to lead people from the path to liberation. The commentaries explain Mara as the lord of evil forces, as mental defilements and as death.

.. [BudRkFn01-02]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita 01-02) (v. 8) The impurities (asubha): subjects of meditation which focus on the inherent repulsiveness of the body, recommended especially as powerful antidotes to lust.

.. [ThaniSFn-V1-2] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 1-2) The fact that the word mano is paired here with dhamma would seem to suggest that it is meant in its role as "intellect," the sense medium that conveys knowledge of ideas or mental objects (two possible meanings for the word dhamma). However, the illustrations in the second sentence of each verse show that it is actually meant in its role as the mental factor responsible for the quality of one's actions (as in mano-kamma), the factor of will and intention, shaping not only mental events, but also physical reality (on this point, see `SN 35.145 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.145.than.html>`_ ). Thus, following a Thai tradition, I have rendered it here as "heart."

                   The images in these verses are carefully chosen. The cart, representing suffering, is a burden on the ox pulling it, and the weight of its wheels obliterates the ox's track. The shadow, representing happiness, is no weight on the body at all.

                   All Pali recensions of this verse give the reading, manomaya = made of the heart, while all other recensions give the reading manojava = impelled by the heart.

.. [ThaniSFn-V7-8]  (Ven. Thanissaro V. 7-8) Focused on the foul: A meditative exercise in focusing on the foul aspects of the body so as to help undercut lust and attachment for the body (see `MN 119 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.119.than.html>`_ ). AN 3.16 gives a standard definition for restraint with the senses: "And how does a monk guard the doors to his sense faculties? There is the case where a monk, on seeing a form with the eye, does not grasp at any theme or particulars by which — if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. He practices with restraint. He guards the faculty of the eye. He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. (Similarly with the ear, nose, tongue, body & intellect.) This is how a monk guards the doors to his sense faculties."

.. [ThaniSFn-V11-12]  (Ven. Thanissaro V. 11-12) Wrong resolves = mental resolves for sensuality, ill will, or harmfulness. Right resolves = mental resolves for freedom from sensuality, for freedom from ill will, and for harmlessness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V17-18]  (Ven. Thanissaro V. 17-18) "Destination" in these two verses and throughout the text means one's destination after death.

.. [VaradoFn01-1]  (Ven. Varado 01-1) Verse 6: "man should live restrained" (yamāmase). PED (yamati): "to control oneself".
