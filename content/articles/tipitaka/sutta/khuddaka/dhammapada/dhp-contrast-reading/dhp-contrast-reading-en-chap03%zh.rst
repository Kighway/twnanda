            from Mara's bonds 
            they'll be freed.

       | Hard to guard, and hard to curb,
       | The wise ones straighten, just as do
       | Skilled fletchers make their arrows true.
     
   * - Translated from the Pali by Friedrich Max Müller) [7]_

        THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE EAST, VOLUME X PART I. THE DHAMMAPADA; TRANSLATED BY VARIOUS ORIENTAL SCHOLARS AND EDITED BY F. MAX MüLLER, OXFOKD UNIVERSITY FBESS WABEHOUSE, 1881; `PDF <http://sourceoflightmonastery.tripod.com/webonmediacontents/1373032.pdf>`__ ( from: http://sourceoflightmonastery.tripod.com)

.. [NāradaFn03-01]  (Ven. Nārada 03-01) Citta is derived from the root cit, to think. The traditional interpretation of the term is "that which is aware of an object" (cinteti = vijānāti). Actually it is not that which thinks of an object as the term implies. If it could be said "it thinks" as one says in English "it rains", it would be more in consonance with the Buddha's teaching. From an ultimate standpoint citta may be defined as the awareness of an object, since Buddhism denies a subjective agent like a soul. According to Buddhism no distinction is made between mind and consciousness, terms which are used as equivalents for citta.

.. [NāradaFn03-02]  (Ven. Nārada 03-02) Pahātave is used in the sense of pahātabba = should be shunned.

.. [NāradaFn03-03]  (Ven. Nārada 03-03) Because no two thought moments arise at a particular time.

.. [NāradaFn03-04]  (Ven. Nārada 03-04) The imperceptible mind is immaterial and colourless.

.. [NāradaFn03-05]  (Ven. Nārada 03-05) Guhāsayaṃ - i.e., the seat of consciousness. It is clear that the Buddha has not definitely assigned a specific basis for consciousness as He had done with the other senses. It was the cardiac theory (the theory that the heart is the seat of consciousness) that prevailed in His time, and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have adopted this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Paññhāna, the Book of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such indirect terms as yaṃ rūpaṃ nissāya, dependent on that material thing. What the material thing was the Buddha did not positively assert. According to the views of commentators like the Venerables Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha the seat of consciousness is the heart (hadayavatthu).

                    One wonders whether one is justified in presenting the cardiac theory as Buddhistic when the Buddha Himself neither rejected nor accepted this popular theory.

.. [NāradaFn03-06]  (Ven. Nārada 03-06) Namely: spiritual wisdom or insight.

.. [NāradaFn03-07]  (Ven. Nārada 03-07) The deeds of an Arahant, a perfect Saint, are neither good nor bad because he has gone beyond both good and evil. This does not mean that he is passive. He is active but his activity is selfless and is directed to help others to tread the path he has trod himself. His deeds, ordinarily accepted as good, lack creative power as regards himself in producing Kammic effects. He is not however exempt from the effects of his past actions. He accumulates no fresh kammic activities. Whatever actions he does, as an Arahant, are termed "inoperative" (kiriya), and are not regarded as Kamma. They are ethically ineffective. Understanding things as they truly are, he has finally shattered the cosmic chain of cause and effect.

.. [NāradaFn03-08]  (Ven. Nārada 03-08) It should not erroneously be understood that Arahants do not sleep. Whether asleep or awake they are regarded as sleepless or vigilant ones, since the five stimulating virtues - namely confidence (saddhā), energy (viriya), mindfulness (sati), concentration (samādhi), and wisdom (paññā) are ever present in them.

.. [NāradaFn03-09]  (Ven. Nārada 03-09) The passions.

.. [NāradaFn03-10]  (Ven. Nārada 03-10) By conquest is here meant the newly developed insight (vipassanā).

.. [NāradaFn03-11]  (Ven. Nārada 03-11) For the Jhānas (absorptions or ecstasies) which the aspirant has developed. The Jhānas are highly developed mental states obtained by intensified concentration.

.. [NāradaFn03-12]  (Ven. Nārada 03-12) Kaëingaraṃ, a rotten log which cannot be used for any purpose.

.. [NāradaFn03-13]  (Ven. Nārada 03-13) That is, the mind directed towards the ten kinds of evil - namely: 1. killing, 2. stealing, 3. sexual misconduct, 4. lying, 5. slandering, 6. harsh speech, 7. vain talk, 8. covetousness, 9. ill-will, and 10. false belief.

.. [NāradaFn03-14]  (Ven. Nārada 03-14) That is the mind directed towards the ten kinds of meritorious deeds (kusala) - namely: 1. generosity, 2. morality, 3. meditation, 4. reverence, 5. service, 6. transference of merit, 7. rejoicing in others' merit, 8. hearing the doctrine, 9. expounding the doctrine, and 10. straightening one's right views.

.. [BudRkFn-v39]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 39) The arahant is said to be beyond both merit and demerit because, as he has abandoned all defilements, he can no longer perform evil actions; and as he has no more attachment, his virtuous actions no longer bear kammic fruit.

.. [ThaniSFn-V37] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 37) "Lying in a cave": According to the Dhp Commentary (hereafter referred to as DhpA), "cave" here means the physical heart, as well as the four great properties — earth (solidity), water (liquidity), fire (heat), and wind (motion) — that make up the body. `Sn 4.2 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.4.02.than.html>`__ also compares the body to a cave.

.. [ThaniSFn-V39] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 39) According to DhpA, "unsoddened mind" means one into which the rain of passion doesn't penetrate (see `13 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.01.than.html#dhp-13>`__ and `14 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.01.than.html#dhp-14>`__ ); "unassaulted awareness" means a mind not assaulted by anger. "Beyond merit & evil": The arahant is beyond merit and evil in that he/she has none of the mental defilements — passion, aversion, or delusion — that would lead to evil actions, and none of the attachments that would cause his/her actions to bear kammic fruit of any sort, good or bad.

.. [ThaniSFn-V40] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 40) "Without settling there, without laying claim": two meanings of the word anivesano.

.. [ThaniSFn-V42] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 42) `AN 7.60 <http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.060.than.html>`__ illustrates this point with seven ways that a person harms him/herself when angry, bringing on results that an enemy would wish: He/she becomes ugly, sleeps badly, mistakes profit for loss and loss for profit, loses wealth, loses his/her reputation, loses friends, and acts in such a way that — after death — he/she reappears in a bad rebirth.
