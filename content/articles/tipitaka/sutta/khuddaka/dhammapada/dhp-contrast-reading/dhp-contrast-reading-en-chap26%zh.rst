**the feature in the Pali scriptures which is most prominent and most tiresome to the unsympathetic reader is the repetition of words, sentences and whole paragraphs. This is partly the result of grammar or at least of style.** …，…，…，
    …，…，…， **there is another cause for this tedious peculiarity, namely that for a long period the Pitakas were handed down by oral tradition only.** …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **It may be too that the wearisome and mechanical iteration of the Pali Canon is partly due to the desire of the Sinhalese to lose nothing of the sacred word imparted to them by missionaries from a foreign country**, …，…，…，

    …，…，…， **repetition characterized not only the reports of the discourses but the discourses themselves. No doubt the versions which we have are the result of compressing a free discourse into numbered paragraphs and repetitions: the living word of the Buddha was surely more vivacious and plastic than these stiff tabulations.**

.. [BudRkFn-v383] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 383) "Holy man" is used as a makeshift rendering for brahmana, intended to reproduce the ambiguity of the Indian word. Originally men of spiritual stature, by the time of the Buddha the brahmans had turned into a privileged priesthood which defined itself by means of birth and lineage rather than by genuine inner sanctity. The Buddha attempted to restore to the word brahmana its original connotation by identifying the true "holy man" as the arahant, who merits the title through his own inward purity and holiness regardless of family lineage. The contrast between the two meanings is highlighted in verses 393 and 396. Those who led a contemplative life dedicated to gaining Arahantship could also be called brahmans, as in verses 383, 389, and 390.

.. [BudRkFn-v385] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 385) This shore: the six sense organs; the other shore: their corresponding objects; both: I-ness and my-ness.

.. [BudRkFn-v394] (Ven. Buddharakkhita (v. 394) In the time of the Buddha, such ascetic practices as wearing matted hair and garments of hides were considered marks of holiness.

.. [ThaniSFn-V383] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 383) This verse, addressed to a member of the brahman caste, is one of the few in Dhp where the word brahman is used in its ordinary sense, as indicating caste membership, and not in its special Buddhist sense as indicating an arahant.

.. [ThaniSFn-V384] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 384) DhpA: two things = tranquility meditation and insight meditation.

.. [ThaniSFn-V385] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 385) DhpA: This verse refers to a person who has no sense of "I" or "mine," either for the senses ("not-beyond") or their objects ("beyond"). The passage may also refer to the sense of total limitlessness that makes the experience of Unbinding totally ineffable, as reflected in the following conversation (Sn 5.6):
                    ::

                     Upasiva:
                     He who has reached the end:
                      Does he not exist,
                      or is he for eternity free from dis-ease?
                     Please, sage, declare this to me
                      as this phenomenon has been known by you.

                     The Buddha:
                     One who has reached the end has no criterion
                     by which anyone would say that —
                         it doesn't exist for him.
                     When all phenomena are done away with,
                     all means of speaking are done away with as well.

.. [ThaniSFn-V388] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 388) Stains = the impurities listed in note 236. On "consonance," see note 265.

.. [ThaniSFn-V389] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 389) The word "anger" here is added from DhpA, which interprets the "letting loose" as the act of retaliating with anger against one's assailant. Some translators read "brahman" as the subject not only of the second line, but also the first: "A brahman should/would not strike a brahman." However, this reading is unlikely, for a brahman (in this context, an arahant) would not strike anyone at all. If a brahman retaliates with anger to being struck, that is a sign that he is not a true brahman: thus more shame on him for having assumed a status not truly his. On the topic of how to react to violent attack, see MN 21 and MN 145.

.. [ThaniSFn-V390] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 390) "What's endearing & not": In the phrase manaso piyehi, piyehi can be read straight as it is, as "endearing," or as an elided form of apiyehi, "not endearing." The former reading is more straightforward, but given the reference to "harmful-heartedness" in the next line, the latter reading serves to tie the stanza together. It is also consistent with the fact that DhpA takes this verse to be a continuation of 389. Given the way in which kavya cultivated a taste for ambiguities and multiple interpretations, both readings may have been intended.

.. [ThaniSFn-V392] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 392) "Brahman" here is used in its ordinary sense, as indicating caste membership, and not in its special Buddhist sense as indicating an arahant.

.. [ThaniSFn-V393] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 393) "He is a pure one": reading so suci with the Thai edition, a reading supported by the Chinese translation of the Dhp.

.. [ThaniSFn-V394] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 394) In India of the Buddha's day, matted hair, etc., were regarded as visible signs of spiritual status.

.. [ThaniSFn-V396] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 396) "Bho-sayer" — Brahmans addressed others as "bho" as a way of indicating their (the brahmans') superior caste. "If he has anything" (reading sa ce with the Burmese edition) = if he/she lays claim to anything as his/her own.

.. [ThaniSFn-V398] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 398) DhpA: strap = hatred; thong = craving; cord = 62 forms of wrong view (listed in the Brahmajala Suttanta, DN 1); bridle = obsessions (sensuality, becoming, anger, conceit, views, uncertainty, ignorance).

.. [ThaniSFn-V400] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 400) "With no overbearing pride": reading anussadam with the Thai and Burmese editions. "Last-body": see note 352.

.. [ThaniSFn-V402] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 402) "For himself, on his own, his own ending of stress": Three different ways that the one word attano functions in this verse.

.. [ThaniSFn-V411] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 411) According to DhpA, "attachments/homes (alaya)" = cravings. "Knowing": the knowledge of full Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V412] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 412) See note 39.

.. [ThaniSFn-V421] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 421) See note 348.

.. [ThaniSFn-V423] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 423) The forms of mastery listed in this verse correspond to the three knowledges that comprised the Buddha's Awakening: knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of how beings pass away and are reborn in the various levels of being, and knowledge of the ending of the effluents that maintain the process of birth.

.. [VaradoFn-V390] (Ven. Varado V.390) Verse 390: "As desires destructive (hiṃsamano) fade/ So his sorrows melt away": I assume, from the previous line, that 'mano' means 'desire of the mind for what's endearing'. This desire is destructive because of associated attachment. As desire fades, so his sorrows melt away.

.. [VaradoFn-V393_395-396] (Ven. Varado V.393_395-396) Verse 393, 395, 396: The word 'brahman' has various implied meanings, including religiosity, saintliness, godliness, divinity. I use these words interchangeably.

.. [VaradoFn-V396] (Ven. Varado V.396) Verse 396: as in verse 221: "free of all identity" (akiñcanaṃ). PED: having nothing.
