.. [NāradaFn07-01]  (Ven. Nārada 07-01) Arahanta has several meanings. It may be interpreted as "Worthy One". "Passionless One". Or one who commits no evil even secretly. He has got rid of both death and birth. After death, in conventional terms, he attains parinibbāna. Until his death he serves other seekers of truth by example and by precept.

.. [NāradaFn07-02]  (Ven. Nārada 07-02) Of life in the round of existence, i.e., an Arahant.

.. [NāradaFn07-03]  (Ven. Nārada 07-03) Sabbadhi, the five Aggregates, etc.

.. [NāradaFn07-04]  (Ven. Nārada 07-04) One gives up sorrow by attaining Anāgāmi, the third stage of Sainthood. It is at this stage one eradicates completely attachment to sense-desires and ill-will or aversion.

.. [NāradaFn07-05]  (Ven. Nārada 07-05) There are four kinds of ganthas (Ties) - namely: i. covetousness (abhijjhā). ii. ill-will (vyāpāda). iii. indulgence in (wrongful) rites and ceremonies (sīlabbataparāmāsa), and iv. adherence to one's preconceptions as truth (idaṃ saccābhinivesa).

.. [NāradaFn07-06]  (Ven. Nārada 07-06) This verse refers to the ethical state of an Arahant. Heat is both physical and mental. An Arahant experiences bodily heat as long as he is alive, but is not thereby worried. Mental heat of passions he experiences not.

.. [NāradaFn07-07]  (Ven. Nārada 07-07) Arahants wander whithersoever they like without any attachment to any particular place as they are free from the conception of "I" and "mine".

.. [NāradaFn07-08]  (Ven. Nārada 07-08) There are two kinds of accumulation- namely: kammic activities and the four necessaries of life. The former tend to prolong life in Saṃsāra and the latter, though essential, may prove an obstacle to spiritual progress.

.. [NāradaFn07-09]  (Ven. Nārada 07-09) To get rid of the desire for food.

.. [NāradaFn07-10]  (Ven. Nārada 07-10) Nibbāna is Deliverance from suffering (vimokkha). It is called Void because it is void of lust, hatred and ignorance, not because it is nothingness or annihilation. Nibbāna is a positive supramundane state which cannot be expressed in mundane words. It is Signless because it is free from the signs of lust etc., Arahants experience Nibbānic bliss while alive. It is not correct to say that Arahants exist after death or do not exist after death, for Nibbāna is neither eternalism nor nihilism. In Nibbāna nothing is eternalised nor is anything, except passions, annihilated. Arahants experience Nibbānic bliss by attaining to the fruit of Arahantship in this life itself.

.. [NāradaFn07-11]  (Ven. Nārada 07-11) By indakhīla is meant either a column as firm and high as that of Sakka's, or the chief column that stands at the entrance to a city. Commentators state that these indakhīlas are firm posts which are erected either inside or outside the city as an embellishment. Usually they are made of bricks or of durable wood and are octagonal in shape. Half of the post is embedded in the earth, hence the metaphor 'as firm and steady as an indakhīla'.

.. [NāradaFn07-12]  (Ven. Nārada 07-12) Tādi is one who has neither attachment to desirable objects nor aversion to undesirable objects. Nor does he cling to anything. Amidst the eight worldly conditions - gain and loss, fame and infamy, blame and praise, happiness and pain - an Arahant remains unperturbed, manifesting neither attachment nor aversion, neither elation nor depression.

.. [NāradaFn07-13]  (Ven. Nārada 07-13) As they are not subject to birth and death. See note on saṃsāra, vs 60.

.. [NāradaFn07-14]  (Ven. Nārada 07-14) From all defilements.

.. [NāradaFn07-15]  (Ven. Nārada 07-15) Since his mind is absolutely pure.

.. [NāradaFn07-16]  (Ven. Nārada 07-16) The pun in the original Pāëi is lost in the translation.

.. [NāradaFn07-17]  (Ven. Nārada 07-17) Assaddho, lit. unfaithful. He does not merely accept from other sources because he himself knows from personal experience.

.. [NāradaFn07-18]  (Ven. Nārada 07-18) Akata, Nibbāna. It is so called because it is not created by anyone. Akataññū can also be interpreted as ungrateful.

.. [NāradaFn07-19]  (Ven. Nārada 07-19) The links of existence and rebirth. Sandhicchedo also means a housebreaker, that is, a burglar.

.. [NāradaFn07-20]  (Ven. Nārada 07-20) Hata + avakāso - he who has destroyed the opportunity.

.. [NāradaFn07-21]  (Ven. Nārada 07-21) Vanta + āso he who eats vomit is another meaning.

.. [NāradaFn07-22]  (Ven. Nārada 07-22) By means of the four paths of Sainthood. Gross forms of desire are eradicated at the first three stages, the subtle forms at the last stage.

.. [NāradaFn07-23]  (Ven. Nārada 07-23) Ninna and thala, lit., low-lying and elevated grounds.

.. [NāradaFn07-24]  (Ven. Nārada 07-24) The passionless Arahants rejoice in secluded forests which have no attraction for worldlings.

.. [ThaniSFn-V92-93] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 92-93) "Having understood food... independent of nutriment": The first question in the Novice's Questions (Khp 4) is "What is one?" The answer: "All animals subsist on nutriment." The concept of food and nutriment here refers to the most basic way of understanding the causal principle that plays such a central role in the Buddha's teaching. As SN 12.64 points out, "There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. Which four? Physical nutriment, gross or refined; contact as the second, consciousness the third, and intellectual intention the fourth." The present verses make the point that the arahant has so fully understood the process of physical and mental causality that he/she is totally independent of it, and thus will never take birth again. Such a person cannot be comprehended by any of the forms of understanding that operate within the causal realm.

.. [ThaniSFn-V94] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 94) "Such (tadin)": an adjective used to describe one who has attained the goal of Buddhist practice, indicating that the person's state is indefinable but not subject to change or influences of any sort. "Right knowing": the knowledge of full Awakening.

.. [ThaniSFn-V95] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 95) Indra's pillar = a post set up at the gate of a city. According to DhpA, there was an ancient custom of worshipping this post with flowers and offerings, although those who wanted to show their disrespect for this custom would urinate and defecate on the post. In either case, the post did not react.

.. [ThaniSFn-V97] (Ven. Thanissaro V. 97) This verse is a series of puns. The negative meanings of the puns are on the left side of the slashes; the positive meanings, on the right. The negative meanings are so extremely negative that they were probably intended to shock their listeners. One scholar has suggested that the last word — uttamaporiso, the ultimate person — should also be read as a pun, with the negative meaning, "the extreme of audacity," but that would weaken the shock value of the verse.

.. [BudRkFn-v97]  (Ven. Buddharakkhita v. 97) In the Pali this verse presents a series of puns, and if the "underside" of each pun were to be translated, the verse would read thus: "The man who is faithless, ungrateful, a burglar, who destroys opportunities and eats vomit — he truly is the most excellent of men."
