       428  1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.”—“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:

       2. “Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the great sixfold base. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.”—“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:

       有一次，世尊住在舍衛城祇樹林給孤獨園。 

       在那裡，世尊召喚比丘們：「比丘們！」 

       「尊師！」那些比丘回答世尊。 

       世尊這麼說： 

       「比丘們！我將教導你們大六處，你們要聽！你們要好好作意！我要說了。」 

       「是的，大德！」那些比丘回答世尊。

       Maha-salayatanika Sutta: The Great Six Sense-media Discourse

       428.   I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"

       "Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.

       "Monks, I will teach you the great six sense-media [discourse]. Listen & pay close attention. I will speak."

       "As you say, lord," the monks responded.

       The Blessed One said:

       “When one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating gratification, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are built up for oneself in the future; [vbb-02]_ and one’s craving—which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that—increases.

His intention is right intention, his effort is right effort, his mindfulness is right mindfulness, his concentration is right concentration. But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been well purified earlier. [vbb-04]_ Thus this Noble Eightfold Path comes to fulfilment in him by development. When he develops this Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of mindfulness also come to fulfilment in him by development; the four right kinds of striving also come to fulfilment in him by development; the four bases for spiritual power also come to fulfilment in him by development; the five faculties also come to fulfilment in him by development; the five powers also come to fulfilment in him by development; the seven enlightenment factors also come to fulfilment in him by development. These two things—serenity and insight—occur in him yoked evenly together. [vbb-05]_ He fully understands by direct knowledge those things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge. He abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge. He develops by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledge. He realises by direct knowledge those things that should be realised by direct knowledge. [vbb-06]_

       11. “And what things should be fully understood by direct knowledge? The answer to that is: the five aggregates affected by clinging, that is, the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. These are the things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge.

       “And what things should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for being. These are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge.

.. [vbb-01] MA: When one does not know and see the eye by way of insight knowledge and path knowledge.

.. [vbb-02] That is, the craving that arises and settles on the eye and forms, etc., holds to them with clinging, and this produces kamma that can generate a new set of five aggregates in the next existence.

.. [vbb-03] When one knows and sees the eye by insight and the path.

.. [vbb-04] The eight factors of the path mentioned here seem to pertain to the preliminary or mundane portion of the path. MT ̣ identifies them with the factors possessed by a person at the highest level of insight development, immediately prior to the emergence of the supramundane path. In this stage only the former five path factors are actively operative, the three factors of the morality group having been purified prior to the undertaking of insight meditation. But when the supramundane path arises, all eight factors occur simultaneously, the three factors of the morality group exercising the function of eradicating the defilements responsible for moral transgression in speech, action, and livelihood.

.. [vbb-05] MA says that this refers to the simultaneous arising of serenity and insight in the supramundane path. The former is present under the heading of right concentration, the latter under the heading of right view.

.. [vbb-06] These are the four functions exercised by the supramundane path: fully understanding the truth of suffering, abandoning the cause of suffering, realising the cessation of suffering, and developing the path leading to the end of suffering.

.. [vbb-07] Here serenity and insight represent the entire Noble Eightfold Path.

.. [vbb-08] MA identifies “true knowledge” with the knowledge of the path of arahantship, “deliverance” with the fruit of arahantship. Here these take the place usually reserved for Nibbāna, the true cessation of suffering.

.. [vbb-09] This passage and each of the following passages repeat the entire text of §§9–11, the only change being in the sense faculty and object.
